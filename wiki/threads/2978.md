<p>if your uploading your map w an image. the image must be JPG format.<br />also relink your map so its available for all languages.<br /><br />edit &gt; options &gt; build language &gt; change from English to ALL. then relink your map</p>

<p>oh, well thanks, but the map got messed up and I had to redo it.. it&#39;s live now though. thanks for everyone&#39;s help. And let me know if there are problems with the map..<br />problems I am aware of: doors don&#39;t swing open or disappear when bought, you can walk through them after buying however.<br />                                        Zombies get caught on open doors wait or dip in then back out of door and they&#39;ll be fine.<br /><br /><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1975947716">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1975947716</a></p>
