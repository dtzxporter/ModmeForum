<p>Thread By: iiR3CKYOURSALY X<br />Hi im currently making a map for bo3 and i am having trouble finding out on how to add in the zombie chronicles zombie models. I have already extracted them using wraith but im having trouble doing one step which requires me to add them in the A.P.E so if anyone could help me by telling me how to do this it would mean the world to me. Thx</p>
