<p>Hi!<br /><br />I&#39;m searching for PHD Flopper but not the original one. I&#39;m searching for the version that will multiply your grenades when you throw them. Has anyone a link?<br /><br />Also I&#39;m searching for Zombie Bosses. The only working one I could find was Brutus and I personally don&#39;t like Brutus that much. Are there any other working Bosses?<br /><br />Thank you for any help!</p>
