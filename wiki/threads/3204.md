<p>I&#39;ve reset my xpak files, and deleted the workshop.json file. I&#39;m not trying to update the map, it&#39;s the first time I&#39;m uploading it.</p>

<p>Limiting the number of custom weapons seems to work.</p>

<p>Apparently it&#39;s an issue with how big the upload file is. If your map contains more than 2gb of assets, it won&#39;t work. Looks like my release will be cancelled until there&#39;s a fix.</p>

<p>no its if _one file after being compressed by steam exceeds 2gb_<br /><br />so your xpak - after the first progress bar when publishing, not the copy you see in your zone</p>

<p><blockquote>I mean it is, coz if you are reducing shit but checking that, 2gb == to roughy .8 lol<br /></blockquote><br />I understand that there is a difference between 2gb and compressed 2gb. However, this is still a major problem for people who want to release higher quality maps that just can&#39;t fit into that margin.</p>

<p>we found a temporary fix already, using a old steam client to upload<br /><br />not a good idea tho, they will fix it eventually</p>

<p>tbf half the maps on the workshop that are like 6 gb should really be less than 2, people just shove everything in</p>

<p><blockquote>tbf half the maps on the workshop that are like 6 gb should really be less than 2, people just shove everything in<br /></blockquote><br />I&#39;m hoping it gets fixed sooner rather than later. And honestly, more than half the &quot;maps&quot; on the workshop shouldn&#39;t be there. But we can&#39;t get an absolute win here.</p>
