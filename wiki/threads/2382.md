<p>Elemental Bows from Der Eisendrache<br />Mostly dumped with Scobalula&#39;s Hydra but also did some manual work. Mostly sound.<br />Also I noted the bow mod on the workshop has missing sounds<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.495.jpg' | relative_url }}"><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.502.jpg' | relative_url }}"><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.496.jpg' | relative_url }}"><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.497.jpg' | relative_url }}"><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.498.jpg' | relative_url }}"><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.499.jpg' | relative_url }}"><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.500.jpg' | relative_url }}"><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.501.jpg' | relative_url }}"><br /><br /><span style="font-size:1.7em;"><span style="color:rgb(65, 168, 95);">Instructions</span>:</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:1.6em;">mapname.<span style="color:rgb(251, 160, 38);">szc</span>:</span><br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}

MathfagBeta testing:-Phane-TrueGamerCalls   Discalimers:   Since it would make the filesize too big, I have not included the voxs for the bow/dragon. You can aquire these sounds from Der Eisendrache of my map. They are not needed for the bows to function. They just make them cooler. The dragon and Bow quest script were added as a bonus so no support is given for them on this thread although prefabs, instructions and instructions to remove them are included in the pack. If you don&#39;t do radiant work, nothing will happen. Bottom line: don&#39;t ask about them on this thread.                 Download: [Spoilers] Show / Hide You can use these on the condition that you don&#39;t chop-top the bow like one of those beaners, don&#39;t paint any idiotic flames on it like some white trash hillbilly, and don&#39;t put a big, gay spoiler on the rear end like you see on all the other zipperheads&#39; bows. It just looks like hell. If you can refrain from doing any of that... it&#39;s yours.&quot;  Forgot the prefabs:   Known bugs: -//  </blockquote><br /> <br />What is the link to your map as well as how would we go about ripping what is needed?</p>

<p>Reply By: TCM<br /><blockquote><em>D-2-K</em><br />change it to luac instead of lua let me know what happens  </blockquote><br /> <br />That is what I am saying, The addon breaks everything in the map because its looking for multiple LUA files he added so as soon as I change it sure it gets past that point, But then it just says missing the next lua file that was not included.</p>

f_damage_to_apply = 3 / 2; // is 1.5 - this is bad

 <br /> <br />your syntax is sloppy anyway in that<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
zom.health/3+500 // bad, its a running calculation

( ( zom.health / 3 ) + 500 ) // correct version
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}

n_damage_to_apply = int( ( zom.health / 3 ) + 500 );
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br /> <br />also, after grabbing arrays of zombies by distance within a range - you never in any example - check is theres a obstruction between the zombie and the given origin with trace checks, so youll be hitting zombies through walls, floors etc etc etc</p>

For example the sound alias would have given me errors as well and I&#39;d need to fix them to use them myself anyway, therefore the csv in the pack would be flawless therefore corrupt download. It just takes 1 bit to ruin it all.</p>

<p>How would I go about making an area to grab the Wraith of the Ancients just like Der Eisendrache after filling up the dragons? And how would I go about doing the upgrade quests too? Also I can&#39;t find Harry&#39;s FX Pack anywhere, do you happen to have a working link to it?</p>

<p>A few fx materials have the wrong columns/rows set<br /><br />This was fixed in a later release, you’ll have to find the image and materials</p>

<p>I can&#39;t find the images and material for fx. All the bows do the same thing as the video</p>
