<p>Thread By: MRFREAKYBWOY<br />Hi all,<br /> <br />First post on this excellent website and wondering if one of you gurus could let me know how I can share a model I created with Maya/APE with my friends?<br /> <br />So, I&#39;ve I downloaded a model of a vehicle and imported into Maya, done the usual things, exported and opened in APE. After doing all the APE bits n pieces I can successfully use the new vehicle model in my maps, however, I would like to send this model to one of my friends so they can just import it into radiant and drag and drop from Models to their map.<br /> <br />What is the process for sharing models that I have created? I just can&#39;t seem to understand which files etc I need to share with him.<br /> <br />Thanks in advance!<br /> <br />Happy mapping.....!</p>

<p>Reply By: Exofile<br />Many ways of doing thiz. I recommend you ZIP up the file, and upload it to Mega or any similar site for them to download from. Sites like <em>justBeamIt</em> is also an option for a more direct transfer of files.</p>
