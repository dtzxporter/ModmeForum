<p>hello,<br /><br />i am requesting some help from any map makers to help me in making a project for black ops 3 mod tools, i had the idea of incorporating a chilling horror experience (like outlast) and mixing it with the original zombies style. The plan is to have an abandoned asylum like verruckt and as the player explores the map they will uncover the secrets of which lies below. I want to setup this project to challenge myself as a map creator and push myself to create something different<br /><br />if anyone is interested in joining this project i will leave my discord at the bottom of the thread and my direct messages on modme will always be open<br /><br />@Callum inglis#7200</p>
