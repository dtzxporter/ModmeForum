<p>Thread By: MJPW<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Hi so Im not sure how to explain this so I made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DylL50fAbY&feature=youtu.be">clip</a>. Lights go off at certain heights or distances and Pack-a-Punch is acting strange even with its own lights fixed.</p></p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br /><p style="text-align:left;">do you have a source of natural light?</p><p style="text-align:left;">as far as i know that makes textures disappear, but give it a try by making a hole in the roof or wall</p></p>
