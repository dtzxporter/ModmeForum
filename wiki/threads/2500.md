<p>Thread By: TrueGamerCalls<br />If you guys aren&#39;t aware, Shifty_Gamer, the creator of the fan-made MOTD remaster released the map this morning. It was amazing playing it, but according to people who are most likely  10 year olds who don&#39;t understand it wasn&#39;t made by treyarch talked shit about the map on every way on possible.<br /> <br />Shifty didn&#39;t take this so well, so he deleted his twitter, the MOTD remaster map, and all of his YT videos, he even changed his YT name to &quot;Unknown&quot;<br /> <br />There are rumors that he was hacked, I can&#39;t confirm anything, for now all we know is we lost a legend.<br /> <br />If you have any contact with Shifty or know more info, please let me know.</p>

Also I think he was planning to quit YT anyway when he goes to Uni soon, people have kind of been pricks to him and overreacted to what was likely accidents</p>

A lot of times I see him say &quot;I ported....&quot; When that gun looks identical to someone else&#39;s port. Also don&#39;t take down that re-upload, since you had work in this map that was wasted. Just such a crappy situation for you, Jerry, and everyone else that helped with the map. I&#39;m low-key happy he shut down all of his social media since he won&#39;t ever do something that fucking dumb again.</p>

I watched his videos of MOTD from the start to now and now this happened? He should&#39;ve just been too resilient and ignore those criticisms, who knows MOTD Remastered by Treyarch may not or in fact unlikely to not come in BO3 in all platforms, sure there&#39;s a NEW loading screen but that only the loading screen, who knows it might come at the next Treyarch&#39;s COD game, I personally think people asked too much from Trey such as remastering maps etc. <br /> <br />But some people who that this was officially made by Treyarch themselves (MOTD:R) at least say to yourself that you professionally mapped MOTD correctly and added exact or near exact models to make it accurate.</p>

He knew the map was still broken and even when offered help he refused and uploaded the map anyway. Also the credits he listed in the map were VERY wrong and he basically made it look like him and Jerri did all the work. There is a lot more to what happened then just Shifty &quot;not ignoring the criticism&quot;.</p>

On screen or workshop post, doesn&#39;t matter it was all still wrong and the map was broken and he didn&#39;t care. He still turned down help and released it. Everything Shifty got was all on him.</p>

I didn&#39;t know it wasn&#39;t only about the criticism...<br />TBH, that&#39;s rude in my opinion by not correctly crediting each person what they did instead falsely crediting them for something they didn&#39;t do. That&#39;s basically wasting someone time in doing something which they didn&#39;t get credited for doing what they did.<br /> <br />I don&#39;t get this, why didn&#39;t he even credited them properly? It&#39;s an easy and simple thing, I credit everyone if I use their scripts or weapons, there&#39;s no harm in doing that. Furthermore, why did he make it look like he and Jerri only the two people who did everything? These are the questions which I know won&#39;t be answered :|<br /> <br />If he knew the map is broken, filled with bugs, then why not accept help? At least in that way, he could&#39;ve squashed so many bugs with the rest of the people who wanted to help. He&#39;s practically waste his entire year in developing this map...</p>
