<p>I&#39;m new to map making. I&#39;ve been making a map adding as much as I can as I go. I don&#39;t want to step on any toes because I see this is an awesome hard working community. I am curious however if there are any places with all the tutorials in one place and scripts. I&#39;ve scrolled through the forums. I just am curious if there are other websites or anything that people use? Is there scripts for boss fights? BO4 Max ammo? Just a place where everything is compiled?</p>
