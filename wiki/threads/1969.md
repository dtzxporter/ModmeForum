<p>Thread By: Noah Gamerscore<br />So I keep getting this error ...<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/FCvIzN1.jpg"><br /> <br />And I&#39;m pretty sure this is preventing me from opening the map because when I try and launch the map it just crashes. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks.</p>
