<p>Yes, it&#39;s not hard to set it up to compile it with the dependencies it needs. However I assure you that CoD: OL will be a challenge for you, the fact that Porter only pushed out a few updates for it is a clear indication of the trouble that awaits you (hint: Kernel Anti-Debug).</p>

<p>In fact, I started compiling wraith cyborg from the day that DTZxporter made the source code public.<br />The missing files for this project are not many, but they are all important.<br />The file structure is really easy to sort out, the project involves<br />wraithX  wraithXArchon  ExternalDeps  libtomcrypt  libtommath<br />Intuition tells me that it needs a file structure table and an assembly association,which prevents me from compiling the project.</p>
