<p>If you get blocky shadows, use a spotlight instead of an Omnilight, worked for me.</p>

<p>Maybe try setting your build lighting quality to high? Then click the lightning bolt.</p>

<p>Do BO3 graphics settings affect this? If so, maybe the shadow settings are really low</p>

<p><blockquote>Weird thing about that is that when I build lightning on high, the shadows still appear like this and the reflection quality becomes worse than medium..<br /><br />I have my settings on high In-game and I have tried building on low medium and high, and there just is no difference for any shadows, only reflections appear to be different when I do that.<br /></blockquote><br />Idek then</p>
