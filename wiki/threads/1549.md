<p>Thread By: h00dedsn1per<br />Okay so I am trying to get the &#39;zetsubou no shima&#39; zombie models working on my map. (I know how to do the process as I have done it many times before with custom zombie models) Anyway I ported all the zombie models and zombie model parts from the map and set them all up in radiant (materials etc.)<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/BPSkgOP.png"><br />However after I have saved and opened up radiant, when I search for the models to check that they are there nothing appears?<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/OEfXx67.png"><br />(yes I know two of the models appear but they were actually ported along time ago for a different purpose) I tried just porting a random model from revelations to check if it was just the zombie models but that did the exact same and didn&#39;t appear in radiant either? It seems that APE is no longer updating radiant, in terms of new models and textures etc. Does anyone know how to fix this? or how this might of happened, it would be a great help thanks <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://aviacreations.com/modme/emoticons/smile.png"></p>

Cheers</p>

I&#39;m not sure what caused this to happen in the first place but its fixed now.</p>
