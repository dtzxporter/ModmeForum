<p>Sometimes in the middle of the game when i shoot the zombie or napalm the game kicks me and i get this strange error. I assume it&#39;s the damage callback on zombies because it happens the moment the bullet collides with the zombie. Does anyone know solution to this? any help would be appreciated.</p>
