<p>Thread By: tjlazor935<br />Anyone know of a way to move the perk icons from the bottom of the screen to the top instead? Having all perks covers up the power-ups and I&#39;d rather have them at the top any way, any help would be much appreciated!</p>

<p>Reply By: Wild<br />You would need to script the new position of the perk HUD, similar to how Harry did it with his perks.</p>
