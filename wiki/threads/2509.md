<p>Thread By: meepmeep<br />We all know it, playing a wicked map and after uploading it, you are not able to create money form it as its copyrighted due a song in an Easter Egg or in-game itself. <br /> <br />This is annoying as we all know, but i might have the solution for this. <br /> <br />I have a registered license in streaming music online. This means i can also place music in videos and uploading it on YouTube without any problems. When you get flagged, just give them your license key of the registered company you are. For me, this would be buma and sena licenses that i need to show. in 99% of the cases, the complaint gets dropped. But sometimes, the fakers can still dispute it. in that case, you have the fully rights to start an lawsuit against the claimer and trust me, they will back off quickly. <br /> <br />Buma talked with me and they let me even know that i&#39;m allowed to use music in my YouTube videos. I&#39;m paying for a license for &#39;&#39;streaming music&#39;&#39; and videos are included in that category. This even works with Facebook as well when you are live streaming there. ( not that u would make money on FB with it, but its always good to know )</p>

<p>Reply By: meepmeep<br /> its kinda sad how people reacting on this. some youtubers would like to earn a bit on the side. Not only for zombie maps but a lot more. Some labels are not interested in reuploads at all and if you have such song in your &#39;&#39;easter egg&#39;&#39; or &#39;&#39;music box&#39;&#39; that could ruin people their uploads, even if they are not intended to make money at all. <br /> <br />For me, its a good way to earn a bit on the side. Reason? simple. i started with nothing, mostly like anyone else. I don&#39;t buy subs or likes. i get the income with some google ads on the website as well for youtube. You all should be happy that we don&#39;t see any ads on modme. Meaning that the server is paid with a good amount of cash at the start or cuz of donators. I have nothing, literally nothing. Being 100% rejected for work while i&#39;m 27. Meaning, because of my &#39;&#39;concentration problems, shaking hands, ADHD&#39;&#39; i&#39;m not allowed to work. sorry but f%ck that, i have way more things to do in life than sitting home waiting to be 70 years old right?<br /> <br />Why would i do nothing while we have the internet to try for creating something we like to do. yes, i know that for gaming is way to late...... or not? i have partners across the world. From NCsoft till epic games and from chubby pixel till fluffy fairy games. I have translated 2 games into fully dutch ( idle miner tycoon and Catan universe ( colonists of Catan online ) ). What did i get in return? some codes for free stuff. i don&#39;t care about earning huge amounts of money. I still pay 95% of all costs i make but would love to reduce it a bit so we can keep the website online for longer.<br /> <br />So, yes.. i would love to earn a bit on the side. Even my mods i release doesn&#39;t have an easter egg for music. Why would i? youtube is cleaning, changing its rules to make it even harder for everyone.</p>

Then the people who PLAY the maps are the ones getting paid.</p>

( as its fan made goal purposes ) </blockquote><br /> The problem is not that people aren&#39;t allowed to ask for donations, or that modders don&#39;t remember to ask for them enough, the problem is that people just don&#39;t donate. It&#39;s kinda sad, but I can understand why. I&#39;ve had a donation link for years, and made sure to show it with every map release and have never received a cent. Maybe you can say &quot;well that&#39;s cause your maps are sh*t&quot; and well, while I can&#39;t argue with that, I know many people who make amazing and well-respected maps who also never receive any donations. The truth is, doing YouTube to make money is far easier than modding to make money, and I think a lot of modders are a bit envious of that (myself included) because modding also takes a lot more time and work. Then someone else plays the thing you spent a year of hard work, collaboration, and problem-solving on, and they make thousands of dollars off of your map that you get 0 of. What&#39;s especially annoying is when they don&#39;t even bother to mention the author&#39;s name, or link the mod in the description. It&#39;s just a smack in the face.<br /> <br />However, we keep on modding. Why? Because no one who does this is in it for the money, or the fame. Because if they were, they would have figured out Bo3 modding is <strong>not</strong> where the money or fame is, and would&#39;ve moved on.<br /> <br />If you&#39;re in the YouTube game, good luck. I recognize that YouTube as a career is still very hard until you reach fame. Just don&#39;t expect sympathy from the modders, who are used to being stepped on and leached off of by YouTubers. All they want is to create something people can enjoy, not something for others to make money off of.</p>
