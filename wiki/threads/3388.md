<p>A Stat Table file and Weapon Options file which shows all camos in BO3 in the Create-a-Class. All stock camos show and all camos that are cut or from zombies or even unused have been given their own menu icon and display name.<br /><br />All CWL camos are in the campaign section with all the campaign camos being combined with zombies.<br /><br />Also I have put all the names of the camos in the stat table so they are easier to find and edit and I have also gave certain camos the &quot;Free&quot; label instead of zm,cp,mp or extras.
