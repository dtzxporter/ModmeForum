<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br />I am kinda confused on what you are looking for here. Are you looking for a simple riser spawner? They have on of those set up already in the default map just copy and paste it after adjusting the zone specific KVPs</p>

For example when i take nuke power up zombies has delay for respawn i need to remove this delay.</p>

#define N_NUKE_SPAWN_DELAY 3
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br /><br /><br />This delay cant be changed because stock scripts cannot be edited, or at least they couldn&#39;t last I checked (I haven&#39;t modded in a while been working on other projects). As far as the spawn delay you might appear to be experiencing when a zombie is killed without a nuke: this is just caused by animation times of spawning in and/or tearing down barriers.</p>

And how to do zombie spawners respawn directly and not spawn in ground? Thanks</p>

level.zombie_vars["zombie_spawn_delay"]

<br /><br /><br />controls the spawning delay but it is also reliant on the following:<br /><br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
level.zombie_vars["zombie_spawn_delay"] = [[level.func_get_zombie_spawn_delay]]( level.round_number );
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br /><br /><br />A thought would be to change the level.func_get_zombie_spawn_delay to something like the following: <br /><br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
function new_spawning_delay()
{
	level flag::wait_till( "all_players_connected" ); // wait some time to make sure our changes apply 
	level.func_get_zombie_spawn_delay = &amp;get_new_zombie_spawn_delay;
}

function get_new_zombie_spawn_delay( n_round )
{
	return 0; 
}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br />Let me know if it works. Simply thread it in your mapname.gsc like usual</p>
