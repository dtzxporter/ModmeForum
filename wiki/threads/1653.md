<p>Thread By: AnUncleanHippy<br />I plan on using a holographic site for a pack-a-punched M4 for one of the maps I&#39;m creating.<br /> <br />I&#39;ve ported it over and it works, just that the holo-site is incredibly high up when ADS-ing.<br /> <br />I&#39;ve changed the ADS anims to the eotech ones but I don&#39;t think it makes much of a difference.<br /> <br />Anyone know how to lower it?<br /> <br />Pic for reference:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/E76MvNl.jpg"></p>
