<p>Thread By: Symbo<br /> <br />HarryBO21 gave me a tips today, and as a good opportunist, i made a small video tutorial on it haha ;)<br /> <br />Turn on the power locally:<br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/24TOyYicwwI" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /> <br />Harry&#39;s usefull comment on the tutorial :<br /> <br />&quot;if the switch is stamped - or if they want to set the script_int on a zombie_door for example they should set it on the trigger same for the traps setting it on the prefab - i believe just automatically sets it to the things &quot;inside&quot; the prefab also if that kvp &quot;isnt&quot; already set on it if you had two structs in a prefab one had a script_noteworthy - the other didnt if you then set script_noteworthy on the prefab, only the struct that didnt have it, will be given it using prefabs makes putting things together much easier, much better than them stamping them&quot;</p>
