<p>I uploaded a map to the workshop, it works fine for me. It loads correctly from the usermap and my uploaded workshop map. However, after uploading it, I received comments telling me there is an endless black screen when loading the map. I have no way of testing this since it works for me. I also received comments that it worked for one person. I recompiled and updated it and that did nothing. I have scripts in the map, very simple ones at that. I thought it could be scripts.</p>

<p>delete all your compiled files, recompile, reupload and subscribe (redownload) it yourself. That should be a true test</p>
