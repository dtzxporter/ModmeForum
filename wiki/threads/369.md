<p>Thread By: soul-toktzt<br />I have a room with furniture, but it&#39;s inside the wall, once you press a button, they&#39;ll move to inside the room, but zombies won&#39;t walk on them (i put planks with clip on a certain angle so you can walk up).<br />I tried using clip_ai, adding pathnodes,.... but nothing works.<br /> <br />Anyone got an idea?<br /> <br /> <br />EDIT: figured out why, for some reason when you have a script_brushmodel as a clip_ai, they won&#39;t be able to stand / walk on it.</p>
