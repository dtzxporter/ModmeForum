<p>when Brutus spawns into my map, I get a connection interrupted and then shortly after my game freezes. He is installed correctly and works on my other maps. ive tried copying the map and its files and putting it in a new map, but nothing seems to work. Any help would be appreciated, this is the Brutus i got <a href="https://forum.modme.co/threads/nsz-zombie-boss-brutus.765/">https://forum.modme.co/threads/nsz-zombie-boss-brutus.765/</a><br /><br />Edit: Today when i tried it again, i didn&#39;t get the connection interrupted my game just crashed instantly</p>
