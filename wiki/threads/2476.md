<p>Thread By: Exofile<br />So the trailer for Call of Duty Infinite Warfare was released a while ago. It&#39;s responses? Not so good. Highest dislike to like ratio any of their trailers have ever achieved.<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://img.prntscr.com/img?url=http://i.imgur.com/JsNRYuU.png"><br /><br /><br /><br />And we&#39;re done! Now, over to the amazing news. DICE is now coming out with another Triple-A game, <strong>Battlefield 1.</strong><br /><br />We shift our eyes over to the recently released trailer I have waited so long for.<br /><br />It&#39;s dislike/like ratio? Oh, see for yourself.<br /><br /><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://img.prntscr.com/img?url=http://i.imgur.com/zN27tUU.png"><br /><br /><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://img.prntscr.com/img?url=http://i.imgur.com/qSVtCWd.png"><br /><br /><br /><br />The comments following the first hour after it was uploaded says it all. DICE started developing the game in 2013. And you know what was popular back then? Futuristic games! That&#39;s right. CoD gave us Advanced Warfare, Black Ops 3 and now Infinite Warfare? DICE started off during the same period, but understood that the &quot;future&quot; is not what we would want later. And for this, we applaude with great gratitude!<br /><br />This is exactly what we wanted, and they served us well. Now, everyone is screaming out &quot;RIP COD&quot;, and I have to agree. Call of Duty&#39;s only wanted attribute now, is Call of Duty 4 Remastered.<br /><br />So sit back, and enjoy this trailer. This is &quot;IN-ENGINE&quot; Footage, meaning it&#39;s not ingame, but it is rendered in the engine, which gives a good idea of how good the graphics will be, for those of you that are so damn interested in it.<br /><br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c7nRTF2SowQ" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I know I come off as a Battlefield fanboy. And I might be, but I enjoy playing both the old Call of Duty&#39;s, and Battlefield. But the truth is, that this is how it is. Players in general want the more modern or old shooters, not the Booster Jumper with lasers and Teleporting. What are your thoughts on all this? You still prefer CoD over Battlefield? Perhaps you&#39;re excited for Infinite Warfare, but because of other reasons not concering the Remastered Call of Duty 4. Do tell! Let&#39;s discuss! <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://aviacreations.com/modme/emoticons/toothlessan.gif"></p>

<p>Reply By: DTZxPorter<br />Again I agree personally Infinite warfare is going to be a terrible game developed by terrible developers, the worst (I even like sledgehammer over IW) But again they should have quit after ghosts.<br /><br /><br /><br />Anywho, I&#39;m not a fan of the battlefield series but we have two sets of mod tools on our way  #letsgo</p>

<p>Reply By: mrpeanut188<br />Holy shit the version of Seven Nation Army they used <br /><br /><br /><br />Game looks badass too, a lot of things really drive back a lot of different aspects of WW1 (e.x. the covering their ears in the bunker) although I guess it wouldn&#39;t be realistic.<br /><br /><br /><br />Unless all you do is sit in a bunker and get shelled for days on end with permanent tinnitus while in knee deep water with your feet growing algae.<br /><br />Then I guess it&#39;d be realistic.</p>

Sure it&#39;s more realistic than Call of Duty, but it has always been a creative game made to be fun, not to simulate real warfare. There are certain aspects of the trailer that doesn&#39;t look right, or a bit off; this is to make gameplay more fun for the players to experience.</p>

But the fact that they try to sell Infinite Warfare by using an old fan favourite? Disgusts me. They&#39;re trying to sell you their new game that is highly disliked, under the cover of the Remastered Call of Duty 4...<br /><br />Oh and Mod Tools for Battlefield? The CTE, Community Test Enviroment produced Operation developed &quot;Operation Outbreak&quot;. A map developed by the community, with intense input and customization from what the players desired. It&#39;s amazing what a community can create working together.<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://eaassets-a.akamaihd.net/battlelog/prod/61d099d23fe104fe673091d470c96970/en_US/blog/en/files/2015/10/20150918_BF4_templeFight_CM_BLTS.jpg?v=1443714579.18"><br /><br />Above is a photo showing Operation Outbreak.</p>

I&#39;m assuming IW refers to Infinity Ward. Are you saying IW is a mod? Care to explain a bit further, as you have me confused.</p>

Which is totally a cod4 mod with 10 mp maps only. Did you see how many dislikes that hit... I&#39;m sure it&#39;s mod.

Usually used &quot;IW&quot; when referring to Infinity Ward myself. And yes, from what you can see for yourself, the Call of Duty 4 Remastered Edition will only be available if you buy Infinite Warfare, which is exactly what I&#39;d expect from Activision.</p>

It is that, and shall be branded as that, and will be a season pass exclusive most likely just like they have done in the past.</p>
