<p>First of all, big shoutout to all of the people that helped make this possible. This wouldn&#39;t be here without all of them, so thank you to everyone credited in the perk&#39;s .gsc file.<br /><br />Hello, and thanks for checking out my second perk.<br /><br />You&#39;re probably asking yourself what this perk does. When the player presses the action slot 4 button (one of the d-pad buttons on controller), they activate &quot;Brawlstar Mode&quot;.<br /><br />While in Brawlstar Mode:<br /><ul><li>You draw all zombie attention away from the other players to yourself<br /><li>You cannot take melee damage from zombies<br /><li>Your weapon is taken and you are given fists that have a variety of effects, mainly dealing a lot of damage<br /><li>When a zombie melees you the Burned Out gobblegum effect triggers, with a customizable shorter range<br /></li></li></li></li></ul>You can choose to have a cooldown on the effect or once the effect is over the perk gets removed from the player and they can only buy the perk a set amount of times. This is done through the gsh.<br /><br />This perk has a ton of customization and can be altered easily, at least the numerical values that control the perk&#39;s effects. Just take a quick look at the .gsh and you&#39;ll see a ton of things that can be changed!<br /><br />I think I may change the perk shader so let me know if you don&#39;t like it.<br /><br />For the jingle, I am using a beat from Prod. Riddiman entitled &quot;Malevolent&quot;. A quick search on YouTube can get you to the song and I would highly recommend you check him out.<br /><br /><strong>I&#39;m sure some of you have skipped that whole block of text, so here is version 1.1 of the perk.</strong><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JzrkyTkQZ5di-YQDMD6Jn7HZILptZQAR/view?usp=sharing">Brawlstar Punch v1.1</a></p>

<p>Gotta fix a couple things in the gdt and I want to change up the script a little bit. The script will still function the same as it did before this post but I will be adding another option so that you can choose whether or not the perk gets taken away (if it isn&#39;t taken away there will be a cooldown on the effect). If you downloaded the perk before this comment you&#39;ll need to redownload it after I update it. The update should be done within the next hour.<br /><br />Edit: took a bit longer than expected because the script was acting weird. Everything should be good now so have at it guys :D</p>
