<p>Thread By: tbone-5<br /><p style="text-align:left;">i am trying to figure out how to make it so the box restricts landing on a ray gun when you have the ray gun mark 2 on you just like Bo2, this could also be helpful for anyone who wants to restrict a person from having multiple wonder weapons in co op as well. any help would on this be appreciated</p></p>
