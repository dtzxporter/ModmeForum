<p>Hi, i was wondering if anyone was able to help me: I am wanting to make a hud that has a tab menu for Shield and Easter egg parts and wanted to know how to go around doing this as I couldn&#39;t find any tutorials or forum posts about it</p>

<p>I&#39;ve asked this before.<br />All that&#39;s publicly released right now is that little green menu in official BO3 maps that pops up in the top left when you GRAB a shield or easter egg piece, not in the tab menu: <a href="https://forum.modme.co/threads/buildable-parts-hud.3153/#post-16183">here</a><br />Scary, who made that, said he was gonna work on the tab menu style thing next.<br />If you wanted to do it yourself, look up some tutorials for LUA (it&#39;s a scripting language for video game HUDs). Check out this link on the wiki which shows what&#39;s different between generic LUA and BO3: <a href="https://wiki.modme.co/wiki/black_ops_3/lua_(lui)/Introduction.html">here</a><br />I will likely start learning it myself, but I haven&#39;t yet.</p>
