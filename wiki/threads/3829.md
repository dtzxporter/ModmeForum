<p>Hello, <br /><br />I have an idea for a script I would like to write<br /><br />I want to put an entity on a path and to follow a set of script structs. Kind of like the cart ride in shangri la but I am not sure what function would be best to use in this case.<br /><br />I also would like for the entity to be able to rotate when it hits this script struct. I am not sure if I explained it all correctly. But Let me know what you think.</p>
