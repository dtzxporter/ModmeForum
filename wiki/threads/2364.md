<p>Thread By: Wild<br />&lt;h5 style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;<span style="color:#3366ff;">Wild&#39;s Advanced ZM Template!</span> &lt;/h5&gt;<br />&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;<span style="color:#3366ff;">Please feel free to request features that you&#39;d like to see in this template!</span>&lt;/h3&gt;<br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>About:</strong></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;"></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">- My advanced ZM template is a modified version of the default ZM template given to us with the mod tools. This template fixes things such as the mystery box, perk machine lights and sounds, and it also sets up files for you such as the zm_levelcommon_weapons.csv file for you to be able to add custom weapons to your map. Over time I hope to update this template and add as many things as I feel fit that will allow you to simply create a new level and get straight to mapping without having to worry about fixing all the bugs that are in the default ZM template.</span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;"></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>NOTE:</strong></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;"></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">- Instructions are included in the download.</span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">- You shouldn&#39;t have to overwrite anything while installing this. If it asks you to overwrite something, do it. It would only ask you if you have one of the things provided in this template installed already, meaning that if it asks you to overwrite something, you should.</span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">- This template will be receiving updates overtime. When you update you can not use a map that you&#39;ve already made, unless you know what you&#39;re doing and can copy updated code into your map if it&#39;s needed. Other than that, when you update the template just create a new map like the instructions say.</span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">- All prefabs used in this template (other than the perk machines and all the default stuff from Treyarch) can be found in the Prefab Browser under _prefabs/_Wild/Advanced ZM Template Prefabs</span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Extra Info (May not have every feature listed):</strong></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;"></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">- I&#39;ve created a new template map that generates when you make a new map. This map contains 5 mystery box locations, all perk machines and the gobblegum machine, every wall buy provided with the mod tools, the zombie actor with a find_flesh struct, a zombie barrier with a corresponding struct, a dog actor with a dog_spawn struct, and more to come!</span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">- Dog rounds are set up automatically. There is no longer a need to copy the dog actor from another map.</span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">- The mystery box is now fully functional.</span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">- Perk machine lights are now working correctly.</span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">- Perk machine sounds are all working correctly.</span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">- Gamedata folder containing your map&#39;s zm_levelcommon_weapons.csv is automatically generated when you create a new map so you can add custom weapons to your map without dealing with getting the file into your map&#39;s folder first.</span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Credits:</strong></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;"></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">- Wild (Creating the template, editing the template map and providing some assesets, setting up the gamedata folder and files so you can use custom weapons)</span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">- DTZxPorter (Fixing the mystery box, fixing perk machine sounds)</span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;"></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">- HarryBo21 (Fixing the mystery box, fixing perk machine sounds)</span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;"></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">- RudySPG (Fixing perk machine lights)</span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">- Wardog (Fixing perk machine lights)</span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">- Treyarch (Mod Tools and original templates)</span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#999999;"><span style="color:transpa;"><strong>-{---Download---}-</strong></span></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://mega.nz/#!6Y52QbKB!6h-oLVxl2LMDF_oHjOfeUVojYNm-bY30HTexeLPt6Iw">Download</a></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Updates:</strong></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;"></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">- 1/15/18 - V1.0 - Initial Release</span></p></p>

<p>Reply By: Wild<br />So you&#39;re complaining that I gave people credit? The point of this template is so people can create a new map and start mapping without spending all their time fixing everything themselves. And the assets I put under my name aren&#39;t in the template yet. I&#39;m working on fixing some textures and sounds and also creating things like wallbuys for every weapon, not just what Treyarch gave us. That&#39;s what I was referring to but they aren&#39;t added yet obviously. But since you guys completely missed the point of this template and are upset that I gave you credit, sorry I guess?</p>

<p><blockquote>The ppsh is still silent for me.<br /></blockquote><br />Hey I just upgraded my PC so I finally have enough room for Mod Tools after not using them for a year or so. Going through my old projects, this one included, and I&#39;ll be updating them all soon. So thanks for letting me know I&#39;ll take a look at it :)</p>

I got a new PC last year but it only had a 500gb m.2 and Modern Warfare and Half-Life: Alyx basically took all that up.

I copied them all and ripped the sounds yeah but if you&#39;re talking about something else I&#39;ll take a look if you give me a link. My big issue wasn&#39;t the aliases. Those worked fine with random sounds, it&#39;s just the actual ppsh .wav sound files wouldn&#39;t play so that&#39;s what I was going to take a look at fixing in audacity or something</p>

<p>dont use that... extract the &quot;actual&quot; aliases with hydra</p>

Then go to your dump and you&#39;ll have several CSV files with all aliases from the map you dumped.. then find a handy program that can select all lines that include a string such as &quot;perk&quot;<br /><br />Notepad++ can do this. Then you can copy them to your alias file.<br /><br />Oh &amp; the reason the PPSH sounds probably don&#39;t work is because one alias sometimes has multiple entrys and you need to copy them all.<br /><br />That&#39;s why using stuff like the link you posted isn&#39;t a good idea since it&#39;s way outdated and may be missing stuff</p>

Yeah I have Sublime so I&#39;m set on that but I&#39;ll use Hydra to get those. Pretty much remaking or looking over to update what was already in the template. If you guys have any suggestions of things to add, or know any updated methods to what&#39;s already done like the perk lights let me know, thanks guys</p>
