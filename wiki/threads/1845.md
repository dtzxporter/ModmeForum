<p>Reply By: soul-toktzt<br /><blockquote><em>Starisko</em><br />Please i really need help :(</blockquote><br /> From my own experience, it&#39;s because of something that requires power, did you add something that requires power? Or changed something in the script from something that requires power?</p>
