<p>Hello once again, In my map I have around 14 perks, (all perks up to bo3 + vigor rush) and Im not sure how to do this but is it possible after the first 7 perks to move the other 7 perks on top so it doesn&#39;t overlap anything? I&#39;ve searched around for this but I couldn&#39;t find anything that helped me out.</p>

Harry&#39;s are much better if you have them</p>

I may be wrong but I believe if you go to Wardogz perk hud .gsh and go through the script then you can fix it the way you want. Also there&#39;s a fix so that the perks don&#39;t overlap your powerups. If you need help just let me know.</p>

Ive also looked at the link you sent and Ive already done that, but maybe what I could do is put some sort of if statement saying after i have 7 perks to start putting it somewhere else but Im not 100% sure on how to do that.</p>

For some reason the sometimes helps with files not showing up</p>
