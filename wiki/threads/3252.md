<p>I&#39;m trying to insert character quotes into my map (using the guide on this website which has helped me a ton in the past so thanks community) but unfortunately there is no sounds in my map because of this error I keep getting:<br /><br />ERROR: c:\program files (x86)\steam\steamapps\common\call of duty black ops iii\share\raw\sound\aliases\zm_castle_vox.csv<br />ERROR: no files for filespec: en\vox\scripted\castle\vox_cast_plr_0_ammo_low_1.wav<br />^^^ the error is repeated for every quote in the folder<br /><br />I included the first error before all the quote errors just to show the location where my .csv file is at. I&#39;ve tried launching the mod tools with just following the online tutorial, tried putting the &quot;en&quot; folder into the root folder, I tried a little bit of everything but obviously not the thing that works. If anyone could help me out it would be greatly appreciated :)<br />________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />vox_plr_0_ammo_low_1,,streamed,en\vox\scripted\castle\vox_cast_plr_0_ammo_low_1.wav,,,UIN_MOD,,,,,BUS_VOICE,grp_voice,snp_voice,,,,95,95,70,700,750,,,,,1,reject,,,1,1,,,,,,3d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<br />^^^ and this is just the code that&#39;s within the .csv file for reference or what not, maybe it&#39;s wrong, etc etc</p>
