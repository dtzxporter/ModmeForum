<p>Thread By: Long Cut<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Whenever I spawn into my map, 4 out of my mystery boxes are glitched. One is properly starting with the box in place, the other properly spawns with the teddy in place. And then the other 4 spawn with the box and teddy together. ive tried using differnet kvps, tried removing some of them, nothing works for me! If someone could walk me through fixing it, that would be appreciated! Thank you!</p></p>
