So would be greatly appreciated to extract both the body and head. Btw has to be the default one which would be easier anyways because I think the clan specific are exclusive.<br /><br />No need to convert the bone structure to BO3 or anything of the sort, really just want the straight up extracted folder with xmodels and textures.</p>
