<p>Thread By: Baconomnom<br />Hey all,<br /><br /><br /><br />So I&#39;ve followed all the tutorials about adding weapons to the box, and I&#39;ve set up a custom weapons.csv file in my map folder, and I&#39;ve referenced the correct path in my map&#39;s .gsc and map.csc as well as zm_usermap.gsc and zm_usermap.csc<br /><br /><br /><br />Now the game does load it in, but it ignores certain things I&#39;ve adjusted.<br /><br /><br /><br />For example: I changed the locus&#39; wallbuy price from 5000 to 1000. In-game it displays the price as 1000, but it still takes 5000 points from your balance. Also forced attachments don&#39;t work, and the weapons I removed from the box, or removed from the .csv file as a whole simply stay in there for no reason, and I don&#39;t know why - can&#39;t seem to add anything either...<br /><br /><br /><br />Also, I can&#39;t seem to load the mentioned DLC guns such as the Thundergun, even when I add them in the zone file, just can&#39;t get them to load, anything I&#39;m missing here?<br /><br /><br /><br />It&#39;s getting very, very, VERY, frustrating.<br /><br /><br /><br />(On a sidenote, how do I change the display name of a certain weapon?)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks a ton!</p>
