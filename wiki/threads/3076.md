<p>Guys, Greyhound no longer works as of today. Also, Archon doesn&#39;t work with Modern Warfare 2019, could we get an update for it?<br /><br />I tested both Greyhound and Archon, there was a patch released this morning that destroyed Greyhound&#39;s functionality. And since Greyhound was abandoned, I really hope the creators of Archon can pick up the project, because there are some fantastic models available in MW2019.</p>
