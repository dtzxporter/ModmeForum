<p>Thread By: mathfag<br />How do I clip a model that is spawned via script and then animated (and deleted when it&#39;s done)? I can&#39;t use a standard collision map because different parts of the model are moving and I need the clip to move with them.</p>

&lt;span class="function-style"&gt;Spawn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="function-parameters"&gt;(&lt;classname&gt;, &lt;origin&gt;, [spawnflags])&lt;/origin&gt;&lt;/classname&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />Looks like if you put {% highlight php %}{% raw %}
script_brushmodel
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
as the classname it could work, though I expect there&#39;s a few other things you&#39;ll have to do to make it a clip and set its size and such.</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />cant spawn script brushmodels and theres no need to animate a clip, you should clip the entire object blocking players from getting anywhere near any moving parts. Anything else would be either not possible or problematic ( notice treyarch do not do this at any point )</p>
