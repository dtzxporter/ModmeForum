<p>Thread By: kingkenny<br />EDIT: I&#39;m sorry, I accidentally messed up the title. It should say: &quot;Play music when spawning and make it unstoppable?&quot;<br />I didn&#39;t find a way to delete my post or edit the title. Maybe an admin can change it?<br /> <br />&lt;hr&gt;<br /><br />Hello,<br /><br />What I&#39;m trying to do:<br /><br />I have a 1 hour long sound file. I&#39;m trying to make it play throughout the whole map. What I&#39;ve tried to do is to link my audio file to &quot;mus_roundstart_first_intro&quot; but that doesn&#39;t work properly. The music will stop as soon as the first round is over. <br /><br />How can i fix that or what would be the best way to get the background music into my map?<br /><br />Thank you!</p>

<p>Reply By: tom5300<br />My guess is that when the game plays the second round&#39;s starting music, it stops/overwrites the first round&#39;s music.<br />So, I would try playing the sound independently with the following script:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
level flag::wait_till( "initial_blackscreen_passed" );
thread zm_utility::really_play_2D_sound("NAME_OF_SOUND_GOES_HERE");
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
Also, change your sound&#39;s name from: &quot;mus_roundstart_first_intro&quot; to something else.</p>

<p>Reply By: modric<br />could also use erthrocks ambient sound system which loops the sound and doesnt get affected by round sounds... also use it for ambient stuff like wind and creaks etc</p>

<p>Reply By: Symbo<br />To remove the rounds sounds you can record a blank audio and specify in the alias this sound for every round sound.</p>

<p>Reply By: tom5300<br />You can add the following lines to your main() to prevent legit players from using the restart commands in the console:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
ModVar( "fast_restart", 0 );
ModVar( "map_restart", 0 );
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
