<p>Thread By: Tjmoney030589<br />Ok I have run into a problem that maybe someone can help me with.... I&#39;m porting all the models from BO2 over to BO3 and every map so far has worked fine. I have now made it to Tranzit and the models just show up as black boxes in Maya. If someone has any suggestions or have come across this problem could you please let me know... Thanks</p>
