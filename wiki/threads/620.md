<p>Thread By: Psh<br />As the title says, I want to add my Tranzit sprinters back in, so where would I go to replace the default anims in the scripts? In addition, is there anything different about porting AI Anims then there was with WAW?</p>

<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br />Currently the running is done in zombie_utility.gsc with the function &quot;set_zombie_run_cycle&quot;, which is not included in the current set of scripts. Without further digging/random guesses at the function&#39;s contents you are unable to change the running anims. If you were really determined you can guess at the animation arrays for running, walking, and sprinting.</p>
