<p>Thread By: Frost Iceforge<br /><p style="text-align:left;">So, I wanted to do a few things. One would be add a Time Attack, where finishing a wave in a certain amount of time would change a wall weapon prefab into different weapons like on Gorod and Revelations with the melee weapons.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The other was to change HarryBO21&#39;s Hell&#39;s Retriever into a Hell&#39;s Redeemer after doing an easter egg (which I already scripted, just need to script this)</p><p style="text-align:left;">Both of these could be done if I could change the Hell&#39;s Retriever prefab and the wallbuy prefab with some kind of script. </p><p style="text-align:left;">Any help is really appreciated!</p></p>

<p>Reply By: DTZxPorter<br /><p style="text-align:left;">You may be able to get away with it converting each brush / model to their script_ other IE: script_model, it&#39;s the only way to interact with them. The model can change using the .model property, but you might have an easier time creating all prefabs in radiant, them moving them with script to a visible spot later on.</p></p>
