<p>Reply By: TheRipppa<br />hmm ok, thanks Harry.ill double check for grammer error in kvps<br /> <br />figured out it was cuz i had the second door trigger name as &quot;zombie_debris1&quot;, figured each trigger needed a separate targetname<br />But saw a tutorial saying you cant repeat the same zone in the gsc like this, if true then how do you have start room going into 2 separate zones?<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
zm_zonemgr::add_adjacent_zone( "start_zone", "zone1", "enter_zone1");
    zm_zonemgr::add_adjacent_zone( "zone1", "zone3", "enter_zone3");
    zm_zonemgr::add_adjacent_zone( "start_zone", "zone2", "enter_zone2");
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
