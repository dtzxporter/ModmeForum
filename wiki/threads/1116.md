<p>Reply By: Wild<br />TBH I am not sure if this will fix it but try copying all the text from one file, open the same file in a better editor such as Sublime or Notepad++, then re-paste it in. It should fix or point out any formatting errors. Like I said I don&#39;t know if that would actually be the problem but either way you shouldn&#39;t use Notepad. I&#39;d recommend downloading Sublime and using JBird&#39;s tutorial to set it up to work with gsc.</p>

I couldn&#39;t find it.<br /> <br />EDIT: thx for the BO2 shaders and MOTD round sounds, can&#39;t wait to get it to work.</p>

Anyway here is the tutorial: <iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vFr9DFstF9w" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /> <br />EDIT: You could also try verifying the tools and BO3 on steam and try compiling and testing again. It&#39;s a simple thing but verifying you steam files usually fixes a lot of problems.</p>

<p>Reply By: Wild<br />zm_yourmap.map located in bo3root/map_source/zm. These are files for the actual Radiant build of your map. If you back up these you can just put them back into that location and radiant will just load up your map like normal, even after a fresh install of the tools. Sorry if that sounds confusing, I am bad at wording lol</p>

<p>Reply By: TrueGamerCalls<br />Cool, when I reinstall mod tools will everything mod tool related reinstall (user_aliases, sound assets etc...)</p>

<p>Reply By: Wild<br />Yup, all fresh and new copies. All you&#39;ll have to do if in the launcher just make a new map like normal, but call it what you map was then go back to that location (bo3root/map_source/zm) and paste the .map file you backed up. Then you&#39;ll have your map like normal but also a fresh install of the tools. Before you actually reinstall them though I&#39;d recommend reinstalling BO3 and deleting everything related to it, then install bo3, then the tools again just to make sure everything is fresh and new.</p>

<p>Reply By: tbone-5<br />it looks like you might be missing this in your zone &amp; it is needed. as for sounds one bad alias line could break all or most other custom sounds so that might be something you will have to figure out yourself by double checking the audio file is in 4800k &amp; is in the right file path<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
