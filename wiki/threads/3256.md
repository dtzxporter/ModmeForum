<p><p style="text-align:center;">Hello there,<br /><br />This is my first post and so I guess this is both an intro and a call for help. I&#39;ve been working on my first zombies map for about ~6 months now. What started as a tester map to get used to Radiant turned into something entirely different. The map takes place on a pretty beat up offshore oil rig. I&#39;m not a huge fan of spoiling gameplay and so I&#39;m leaving this description intentionally vague.<br /><br />The map itself is basically feature complete at this point with all functionality in. I&#39;d really like some help further testing this as well as general feedback on the gameplay itself. As this site was incredibly helpful when I was putting this thing together, I thought I&#39;d put the call for help here. If this is something that would interest you, either reply here or ping me directly.<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.735.jpg' | relative_url }}"><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.736.jpg' | relative_url }}"><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.737.jpg' | relative_url }}"><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.738.jpg' | relative_url }}"><br /><br /></p></p>
