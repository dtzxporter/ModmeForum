<p>Thread By: kingkenny<br />Hello!<br /><br />Is it possible to create animated textures? <br />I wasn&#39;t able to find a tutorial on it but i know that there are animated textures which are basically just video files from the blackops3/videos folder in Radiant/APE.<br />Is it possible for me to create an animated texture/gif/video to incude into my map as a face?<br />What would be the correct way to do it and is there a tutorial for this?<br /><br />Thank you very much!</p>

<p>Reply By: mikey<br />There is a setting in Material type, Cinematic_mp4_rect, very first in the list.<br /> <br />It might be something to try out, mp4 is a video file.<br /> <br />Cant see it?<br />You need to have Material_Cat as Geometry.</p>

<p>Reply By: kingkenny<br />I&#39;ve found a way to make animated textures.<br /><br />After looking into a model with an animated texture i found &quot;t7_graphic_detail_ad_coalescence_logo_flip_03&quot;<br /><br />It&#39;s a lit_emissive_scroll -material that looks like this: <iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HJsx1HO" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br />I will try to duplicate this material and then create my own animated texture this way.<br /><br /><br />I&#39;m still open for answers.<br />If anyone knows a better way please let me know! :)</p>

<p>Look at how they animate the flame images on FX. You can use that method.</p>

<p>By any chance does anyone know how to actually add in Animated Textures?<br />I would love to create a WWE Arena with this as a floor texture.<br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J1A1I5Ce0kgglHuIHJ" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
