<p>Thread By: slayer3500<br />Hello,<br /> <br />my friends and me are playing much mp custom games against bots. we want to rise the time of the function start_threat_aim() in...Call of Duty Black Ops III\share\raw\scripts\shared\bots\_bot_combat.gsc script, because we want to make them a little slower aiming at us and dont want to loose their skill features/characteristics (turning around if someone fires a weapon nearby) if choosing lower difficulty like &quot;hardened&quot; for example.<br />so what i have done already:<br />-created mp mod called &quot;mp_botmod&quot; with BO3 MC Launcher.exe<br />-created path ...Call of Duty Black Ops III\mods\mp_botmod\scripts\mp and copy pasted _bot_combat.gsc file into scripts inside and renamed it to mp_botmod.gsc<br />-inside the script mp_botmod.gsc i modified the values<br /> <br />its not working, because im dump...<br /> <br />is there someone who is willing to help me create a mod with script within right path so i can modify the bot values to my favor, please. i will donate for a cup of coffee.</p>
