<p>Hello everyone, recently I&#39;ve decided to port over buried from Black Ops 2 into Black ops 3 using the expansive mod tools, I&#39;ve used 2 tools called Husky and Greyhound to export each model and texture of the map and I&#39;m trying to get help as to how I import everything into Blender and then export it as Xmodel to then put into Radiant, I&#39;m very new to this, I&#39;ve never used any mod tools before but I do have blender and 3d software related experience. I&#39;d love to get as much help as I&#39;m able to with this and I&#39;ll pay for some help.<br /><br />Links:<br /><a href="https://github.com/CoDEmanX/blender-cod">https://github.com/CoDEmanX/blender-cod</a> (Tool I cant figure out how to use for exporting Xmodels for blender)<br /><a href="https://github.com/Scobalula/Greyhound">https://github.com/Scobalula/Greyhound</a> (Tool I used to export animations and textures)<br /><a href="https://github.com/Scobalula/Husky">https://github.com/Scobalula/Husky</a> (Tool I used to export an OBJ of the entire map)<br /><br />P.S. I&#39;d be over the moon if some of you helped me get scripts for BO2 weapons and some other perks like Vulture Aid and Banana Colada (Wanted to add this just for fun)</p>

You can&#39;t use the ripped OBJ and convert to an xmodel. It simply is too big, and crashes radiant.<br /><br />However,  you can absolutely use the ripped GEO and buildings, providing you split it up into separate XMODELS (COD blender tools), then re-import them separately...i.e. split into separate buildings, roads, vista geo, vista buildings  I have done this, and BO3 Handles it fine. However, what you want to do when its finally all loaded in, is split it back up into Prefabs, and make Clips around each model for collision and texture type (as xmodels don&#39;t carry this information)<br /><br />Do not correct Axis to 0,0,0 or it will not be in the correct place in re-import. Keep in mind that You must be below 40,000 tri&#39;s to get an xmodel to work the conventional way (without Porters Xmodel converter tool), then APE will load it just fine without having a fit.<br /><br />I also disagree with the texture export. I rip all textures, and all xmodels (not combined GDT - with textures). I go into the xmodel directory, search *.png (or tiff..or whatever you use), copy all into the &quot;textures&quot; directory. When it asks to overwrite, click yes. When it completes, all the model textures will be hilighted. Delete them. This way you have no duplicate textures between the main texture directory and the models .<br /><br />You can also use Makecents&#39; tool C3IG (use google) which converts xmodel_export to xmodel_bin, and creates a GDT.<br /><br />If this sounds like too much work (and it is...i&#39;ve been doing this shit for years before greyhound and husky), then you either spend more time learning the tools, or wait until someone does it for you. Good luck. You&#39;ll need it ;)</p>
