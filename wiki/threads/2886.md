<p>So I was using ARDIVEE snow tutorial from his <a href="https://wiki.ardivee.com/article/snow/">website</a>.<br /><br /><strong>First of all:</strong><br /><blockquote>Adding snow to your map is quite simple, in radiant you have to add an outdoor volume covering your whole playable area. </blockquote><br /><br />Do I need to apply this outdoor volume on WHOLE PLAYABLE AREA including indor area?<br /><br />The problem is I did it, and snow is working great. The problem is - it is snowing even indoors.<br /><br />So I decided to reposition <strong>&quot;outdoor_volume&quot;</strong> I created before. The thing is I can&#39;t find it in the entity list, I cleared the filters and still NOTHING. <strong>&quot;outdoor_volume&quot;</strong> is gone and I can&#39;t edit it.<br /><br /><em>Any ideas?</em></p>

<p>i think you have to check the checks for 1-4 maybe.  and for the volume being gone idk check filters or ctrl shift h to unhide stuff</p>

<p>So it supposed to be like that? I mean the <strong>outdoor_volume</strong> is suppose to cover ALL AREAS? As far as I remember, I checked 0-3 as tutorial says.<br /><br />Filters and unhide doesn&#39;t work. It&#39;s gone. I can&#39;t even find outdoorbounds texture in the &quot;all in use&quot; filter.</p>

<p>Nevermind. It is just me being stupid. The thing is - there was no outdoor_volume :D. I added another one and checked ALL FOUR CHECKS. Before I checked only 3 of them.</p>
