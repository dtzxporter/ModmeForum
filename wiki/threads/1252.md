<p>Thread By: Frost Iceforge<br />I was wondering how you would make a health bar like in WW2 zombies? My idea was one by the score counter that looks something like this? (I&#39;d mess with it once I had basic script to make it look nicer)<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/a94c9c84c0c936f3e2f99c3900569cc1.png"><br />If it&#39;s like horizontal along top or bottom of screen that&#39;s okay too.<br /> <br />It can either grow or just stay same size with Jug.</p>
