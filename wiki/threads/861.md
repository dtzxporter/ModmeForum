<p>Thread By: The Black Death<br /><p style="text-align:left;">By this, what I mean is is there a function to detect what mod the user currently has loaded? (E.g. usermaps)</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">The reason I say this is because this means anti-cheat scripts for black ops 3 could be further enhanced via this, since people could restrict what mod people are allowed to use (by default limiting to usermaps) and then this would mean using mod menus would be difficult if not impossible if the map was then scripted to go back to the lobby if a mod other than the one allowed is used.</p></p>

<p>Reply By: DTZxPorter<br /><p style="text-align:left;">That is easily fakable, the real way is to include important and required scripts in a separate mod, which link back to the maps &quot;mod&quot; and then your map will only work with that specific mod loaded (one a time)</p></p>
