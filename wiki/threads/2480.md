<p>Reply By: mrpeanut188<br />I <strong>really</strong> disliked the IW reveal, but the zombies actually seems interesting. Looks like they&#39;re making the mode more casual which is a good thing, <br /><br />zombies is getting stale. Becoming more focused on having fun then being rewarded for skill may alienate the more hard-core players but I think<br /><br />for a series like CoD where it&#39;s been a straight cash-grab for the last few years, it&#39;s a good move for Activision. I can&#39;t really say for certain though,<br /><br />they are directly copying many facets of Treyarch&#39;s zombies, and I think having a new developer with a new direction is great.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Also, I really like our cast: Hasselhoff, Pee-wee Herman, Snooki, and ScHoolboy Q. That Go Getem Tiger shirt is probably the best thing to come out of all this so far.</p>
