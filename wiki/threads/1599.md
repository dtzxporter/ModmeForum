<p>Thread By: mw3.<br /><p style="text-align:left;">I know I can change the name to tag_weapon but that is not the problem.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The problem is that I cant find a rig that works by putting in the bo3 anims and export them as xanim for bo3.</p><p style="text-align:left;">I want to have different knives with the bo3&#39;s combat knife anims in bo3.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Whish there was an easier way than using a rig to convert them in to older anims and then back again just to make them work for the game you got the anims from. </p></p>
