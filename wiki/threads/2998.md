<p>Hey all, I was curious about what settings I should mess around with to get a really good coloring on my L.U.T for my map. Ive messed around with it a lot and I can never get it to a really crisp color that a lot of good mappers use. Basically, I want a crisp and clean L.U.T. that brings out the definition in my map for the colors. Not so much like Xela&#39;s maps, but something like that lol. (His maps look incredible due to his L.U.T.&#39;s)<br /><br />Also, ive heard of &quot;Docq&quot; tables, but when I try to download them I can&#39;t convert them or use them because they are a &quot;.3dl&quot; file. Does anyone know a download site that has L.U.T&#39;s that can be edited in the program GIMP, so I can change them?</p>
