APE doesn&#39;t take _export files..</p></p>

Will notify you or have him post here.</p></p>

<p>Reply By: SE2Dev<br /><p style="text-align:left;">I&#39;ve been aware of this issue for a while, but haven&#39;t gotten the chance to fix it. Blender-CoD as a whole really needs a full rewrite and cleanup at this point and I haven&#39;t had the chance to do so yet.</p></p>

<p>Reply By: _Mr. Unp3rf3ct<br /><p style="text-align:left;">So far I have made 4 models in blender and converted them. It all worked out perfectly, but for one, which was a mess up I did when I modeled it. I never had issues related with your Comment.</p></p>

<p>Reply By: XxCAFxX<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Alright guys, thanks for all the replies, one more thing i forgot to mention is that the file that blender exports is about 103mb which doesnt seem right to me </p></p>
