<p>Thread By: soul-toktzt<br />First of all, i couldn&#39;t remember what it&#39;s actually called and i was not sure if it has to go in Radiant section or general to be honest.<br /> <br />I have clip_ai&#39;s and pathnodes. But the won&#39;t come up this thing. Sometimes where i&#39;m on the higher brush they go towards it, stand on it and then they don&#39;t move anymore.<br /> <br />I tried without clip_ai&#39;s too, i even deleted it and placed it again.<br /> <br /><a href="https://gyazo.com/c5b555d3e813c4c11b5a885dbfd5a30c">https://gyazo.com/c5b555d3e813c4c11b5a885dbfd5a30c</a><br /> <br /> <br />Edit: apparantly zombies don&#39;t like to walk on brushmodels.</p>

<p>Reply By: Fil he Modder<br />just a quick note: when making clips for zombies, I would strongly recommend using the clip_monster as it seems to be more appropriate and possibly less buggy. hopefully that helped in one way or another.</p>
