<p>Hi all, <br /><br />was wondering if there’s anyone out there who would be willing to help me with making a custom perk machine including both the model and the skin/texture/shader for it?<br /><br />the perk itself is currently made and uses a tombstone machine as a placeholder<br /><br />any help would be great :)</p>
