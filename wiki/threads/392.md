<p>Thread By: MRFREAKYBWOY<br />Hi Guys,<br /> <br />I created a load of prefabs so I can use cross maps, but I have noticed that when I stamp a prefab I have made the user defined KVPs get deleted.  It&#39;s not too much of a problem because I know which KVPs are lost, but it would be great to make sure ALL user KVPs are still there after stamping a prefab.<br /> <br />Anyone know how to do this?<br /> <br />Thanks,</p>
