<p>Thread By: Scary_Branden<br />Right now i have Snpryms Melee Weapons found  here<br /><a href="https://aviacreations.com/modme/index.php?view=topic&tid=1282">https://aviacreations.com/modme/index.php?view=topic&amp;tid=1282</a><br />and i was looking for a .meleeweapon template asset and make it so the weapons act similar to a bowie knife. also planning on porting several multiplayer melee weapons to zombies too but the whole &quot;porting&quot; thing will be for another day. Any help on making a bowie knife type replacement will be greatly appreciated. Thank you</p>
