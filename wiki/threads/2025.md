<p>Thread By: NoScopeNinja25<br />I ported the Intervention from MW2 and got every thing except the scope overlay to work.  I have been searching the internet for a tutorial to get the overlay to work but the only thing I have found is a brief explanation of what to do.  All it says to do is create an image asset in ape and put the name of the image for the shader in the ADS Overlay settings.  I did that but it doesn&#39;t work, to test that my image was working I tested this on somebody else&#39;s sniper port and it worked.  I don&#39;t know what else to do.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.<img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/tOzpTOD.gifv"><br /> <br />Image asset settings:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://imgur.com/rHp7Mp5"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/l2cavqq.jpg"><br /> <br />bulletweapon file ADS Overlay Settings:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/8dyUEt9.jpg"><br /> <br />In game:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/tOzpTOD.gifv"><a href="https://imgur.com/tOzpTOD">&lt;img title=&quot;source: imgur.com&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tOzpTOD.gif&quot; alt=&quot;tOzpTOD.gif&quot;&gt;</a><br /> <br />&lt;h2&gt;Update: Fixed&lt;/h2&gt;<br /> <br />The Zoom In Frac and the Zoom Out Frac were set to zero.  After I changed these values and recompiled my map the overlay started working.<br /> <br /><a href="https://imgur.com/xbgYPX9">&lt;img title=&quot;source: imgur.com&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xbgYPX9.gif&quot; alt=&quot;xbgYPX9.gif&quot;&gt;</a></p>

<p>Reply By: itznvy<br />The same thing happened to me when i ported it, check the ads settings, the ads overlay looks fine.<br /> <br />Also you should probably check hold breath to steady since its a sniper lol</p>

<p>Reply By: NoScopeNinja25<br />I tried messing around with the ads settings and the ads options a little.  I still can&#39;t get it to work.<br /> <br />These are my settings:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/rPaxkTC.jpg"><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/nOR4WZR.jpg"><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/W1JZV7v.jpg"></p>

<p>Reply By: NoScopeNinja25<br />I finally figured out what was causing the problem.  It was because the Zoom In Frac and the Zoom Out Frac were set to zero.  After I changed these values and recompiled my map the overlay started working.</p>
