<p>Thread By: Dick_Nixon<br />I&#39;ve seen a system featured in quite a few maps where you do a little waster egg, then a free weapon drops. Does anyone know how to replicate that, whether it be through a shootable Easter egg, or just a plain power-up? As well, I&#39;ve only seen this in Madgaz&#39;s Fabrik Der Untoten(one of the early versions), where he had the magnum under the table in the PaP room. Does anyone know how to spawn weapons into the map like that, but have them there at the start of the game(not manually spawning them in through console commands). Thanks!</p>
