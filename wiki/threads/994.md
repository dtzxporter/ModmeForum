<p>Thread By: soul-toktzt<br />Hey all<br /> <br />I got <a href="https://pastebin.com/mNZY4RVx">this little script</a> (it&#39;s not the actual power btw, those are just roots with a pulse effect).<br />But for some reason, i can&#39;t use the trigger_use.<br /> <br />Can anyone help me out? This should work.<br /> <br /> <br />If you have a trigger and brushmodels in a prefab, they should work, right?</p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />The script looks completely fine and should work no problem. the only reason that i can think of that your trigger doesnt work is, that you named it wrong or that the script isn&#39;t activated. Add some iprintinbold();&#39;s. There&#39;s nothing wrong if they&#39;re in a prefab</p>
