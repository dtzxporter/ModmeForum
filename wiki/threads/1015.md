<p>Thread By: The Black Death<br />Hello, scripters!<br /> <br />I&#39;m a new mapper/modder, and I&#39;ll be hopefully releasing my first map at some point soon!<br />This map, is the Station of Anguish (also known as Aldwych)<br /> <br />It is based off a real disused London Underground station and will feature a full quest (EE) and some side EEs.<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/YourCountryNeedsYou.jpg"><br /> <br /><strong>What I&#39;ve done:</strong><br />About 60% of the mapping.<br />I&#39;ve put in all sorts of stuff e.g. guns, custom shaders etc etc.<br /> <br />&lt;em&gt;You&#39;d get more info but Chrome crashed on me once I wrote the last post!&lt;/em&gt;<br /> <br />I&#39;ve made this post because I&#39;m not well known within the community so it is difficult for me to find a scripter in any other way. But I don&#39;t want my map to be lackluster in content so that&#39;s why I&#39;m making this. This map has been under construction for 4 months now, and I could easily see it reaching the 7 month mark before release. While the mapping may seem like I haven&#39;t for that time, I&#39;ve done a lot of things on the modding side, e.g. weapons &amp; fixes etc.<br /> <br /><strong>Screenshots of the map</strong><br />These also showcase the weapons I ported (and there&#39;s also a few from Rico &amp; Harry in them xD)<br />&lt;em&gt;There&#39;s also quite a few things in them which is getting changed, e.g. the eastern disused passage will get reworked...&lt;/em&gt;<br /> <br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a/1BeJz" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /> <br />So that&#39;s that. Hopefully this will bring some attention. If you&#39;re interested in being the scripter for my map please either respond to this post, PM me on Modme, or contact me on Discord (The Black Death#9834).<br />Experienced scripters only please.<br /> <br />Thanks guys.</p>
