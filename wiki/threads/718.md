<p>Reply By: Ping998<br />Can i ask: Does this effect stamin-up? Because I used a similar powerup on Return To Stairway To Hell and since the powerup changed the run speed to a new and then back to default, stamin-up was overwritten.</p>

I checked the staminup scripts and they dont use SetMoveSpeedScale like I do to change the speed of the player. I also ran some tests myself and I can confirm it appears to have no effect. Your guy moves way too fast with staminup and fast feet hahaha</p>

<p>Reply By: OWNSAUCEPIMP<br />So, I downloaded the zip file and it did not contain the model for the zombietron_boots. Is there a chance someone can update the download file or point me to where it exists?<br /> <br />^1ERROR: xmodel &#39;zombietron_boots&#39; is missing</p>

It was not, I did have it when I started, but moving the files to a different steam library didn&#39;t move them and so I deleted them thinking they were just duplicate files. If I don&#39;t post again, it&#39;s safe to assume this fixed the issue. Thanks again for the suggestions.</p>

<p>Reply By: MyNameIsNobody<br />In the instructions it says add this to gsc:<br /> <br />// NSZ Bottomless Clip Powerup<br /> #using scripts\_NSZ\nsz_powerup_bottomless_clip;<br /> <br />But since this is fast feet it should say this:<br /> <br />// NSZ Fast Feet Powerup<br /> #using scripts\_NSZ\nsz_powerup_fast_feet;<br /> <br />Is that right? I really don&#39;t kow a damn thing about scripting, thats your area, but I think this was a mistake?? Thanks for all the great scripting you do!</p>
