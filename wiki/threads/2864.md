<p>Im getting really frustrated because ive been searching the internet for Brutus downloads, for what seems like forever and I cant find any downloads or websites that have him. Even youtube videos showing how to download ports dont even have links to the files to download Brutus, and when I type in the link in the video the page doesn&#39;t exist.<br /><br />Is it even possible to port him over? Im not looking to take his animations from in game BO2 and process him, I just need to download the files and put him in my game. (Im a busy student who doesnt have the time to port animations and what not). Let me know if it is possible to get him in the mod tools through a file download.<br /><br /><br /><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/455130">Call of Duty: Black Ops III – Mod Tools</a> &gt; <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/455130/discussions/0/">General Discussions</a> &gt; Topic Details<br /><br />Date Posted: Oct 30 @ 5:52pm<br />Posts: 0<br /><br /><a href="https://forum.modme.co/javascript%3AForum_UnsubscribeFromTopic(%201642052612837150826%20);">Unsubscribe from discussion</a><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://steamcommunity-a.akamaihd.net/public/images/sharedfiles/searchbox_workshop_submit.gif"><br /><br /><a href="https://forum.modme.co/steam%3A//openurl/https%3A//support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4045-USHJ-3810"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://steamcommunity-a.akamaihd.net/public/images/skin_1/iconRules.png"> Discussions Rules and Guidelines</a></p>
