<p>Thread By: ProbablyTrue<br />I have been porting models from MWR and Ghosts recently, and in APE the models look perfectly fine, but once I go into Radiant the textures on the models look very low resolution. Does anyone know the cause of this and how to fix it?</p>

<p>Reply By: Wild<br />Open APE and select the GDT for the model. Click on the images for the model&#39;s texture and on each of them check the boxes that say &quot;Do Not Resize&quot; and &quot;Always High Resolution&quot;. Do that for each of the textures maps.</p>
