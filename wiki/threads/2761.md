If you create the sounds, attach them to a node and setup the alias you can create it how you like. If you look in your black ops 3 root and for the help docs you can find one on sound. It explains what all the parameters do. You can achieve the effect you are looking for with just 4 parameters. When I am next on my machine I will post an example here if I remember :)</p>
