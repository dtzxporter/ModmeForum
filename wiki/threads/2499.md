<p>Thread By: Exofile<br />After a somewhat positive outcome, a clan has been made.<br />Simply create an account on Bungie.Net &amp; request to join (LINK NOT MADE).<br />Please PM me here or on Discord your username on Bungie.Net and the request will be accepted when possible.<br />And before you ask, yes; we&#39;re open to all platforms.<br /> <br />What&#39;s the point of a clan?<br /><ul><li>Weekly Clan Rewards.<br /><br /><li>Clan Banners.<br /><br /></li></li></ul>Overall, Destiny 2 will have alot more content oriented on clans, and thus having a large community with it will make matchmaking &amp; progression be more benefitial for everyone involved.</p>

<p>Reply By: Exofile<br />Seems there is a somewhat positive response, but nothing ecstatic.<br />Never the less, I&#39;ve edited the OP with the clan. Simply make you</p>
