<p>Thread By: ItsJasonn<br />Hey there,<br /> <br />What I am trying to achieve is to port the SPAS-12 from MW2, but when I do that it has all of the attachments on it, red dot, heartbeat sensor, silencer, etc. I tried using the &quot;Hide tags&quot; box in the bulletweapon GDT file, but for some reason this does not hide the tags (joints). Anyone know what to do if you don&#39;t want those attachments to show up in-game?<br /> <br />Thanks!</p>

Like if you click on the tag_red_dot joint or whatever, the red dot sight on the weapon turns pink?</p>
