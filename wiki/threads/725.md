<p>Thread By: snprym<br />Does somebody know how to fix character quotes for the origins/SOE crew in custom zombies? Its kinda boring and silent with nobody talking. It is possible, in the new map Christmas Carol the characters talk</p>

<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br />Not sure how to do this myself. In Christmas Carol I did the boss Reaper, so I havent a clue. I imagine its probably something simple to add the vox system in. MakeCents and RDV did the remaining scripts. Give them a tweet and ask</p>

<p>Reply By: WARDOGSK93<br />from what ive been told is the vox sounds are not included like weapons were not so you would just have to port the sounds and create alias for them but tbh i havnt done this myself so dont know if it will work just waht ive been told should work</p>
