Make sure that brush you just made is selected. Go to the top of radiant and click the &quot;Selection&quot; tab. Go down the list and hover over &quot;Select&quot; and then finally go over to &quot;Select Inside&quot;. This will select everything that was inside the brush you made and it will automatically delete the brush as well.</p>

If there are brushes and stuff then you need to go in and manually select everything :/</p>
