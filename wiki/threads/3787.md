<p>So I need to change a model from one to another seamlessly.<br />Using setmodel, there is a noticeable model swap happening. It is super noticeable if there is a light behind the model.<br />I tried using show/hide with 2 ents, but you can still notice the swap sometimes. The first show/hide normally isn&#39;t noticeable, it&#39;s just when I do show/hide the second time to show the original model.<br /><br />Is there any way around the &quot;flicker&quot; when swapping between two models?<br />It&#39;s not the end of the world, but I figured I&#39;d ask anyway. Thanks for your time!</p>

<p>Put the other model in your map under the floor<br /><br />The pop your seeing is it loading<br /><br />If there’s a copy of the model in the map somewhere it won’t pop</p>

<p>Same happens to the perks when they turn on if you have on/off models<br /><br />The pop also only happens “once” coz of the load<br /><br />This is why you sometimes find floating junk under stock maps, it’s just to preload it</p>

<p><blockquote>Slap in a fx when you swap<br /></blockquote><br />I would... but the models are.. uh huge haha:p I don&#39;t think I could make something loook good enough to mask it honestly.<br /><br /><blockquote>Put the other model in your map under the floor<br /><br />The pop your seeing is it loading<br /><br />If there’s a copy of the model in the map somewhere it won’t pop<br /></blockquote><br />I&#39;m going to give that a shot, thanks Harry! I just assumed when you precache the model, it loaded it too. This is why you shouldn&#39;t just assume haha<br />Edit: you were 100% correct Harry! There is no pop that happens now! I&#39;m glad I asked and didn&#39;t just compromise.</p>

<p>Precache is to preload content, still has to be allocated, just means it’s ready</p>
