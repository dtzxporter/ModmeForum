<p>Thread By: Frost Iceforge<br />I am trying to create an iron sights variant of a DSR I downloaded from modme. I removed the sniper overlay, removed the scope, added the ironsights, added the ironsights ADS animation, and now when I ADS, my viewmodel and HUD still disappear as if I had a scope. Where is the setting to prevent that in the weaponfile?</p>

<p>Reply By: Frost Iceforge<br />NEVERMIND! I got it! In ADS Overlay Settings, I set reticle to &quot;none.&quot;</p>
