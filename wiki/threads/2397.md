It&#39;s not very hard though.<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://imgur.com/ulKvtUl.png"></p>

<p>Reply By: Ping998<br />I&#39;ve got all the scripts in place and I&#39;ve spawned the model successfully, but zombies don&#39;t attack it?<br />Not sure where to link the name of the attackable created in APE to the script?<br />Any suggestions?<br /> <br />- Ping</p>

<p>Reply By: Ping998<br />This seems to have a lot of trouble working in co-op, the zombies rarely attack the object and instead attack the player. Is there a way to fix this?<br /> <br />Thanks,<br /> <br />- Ping</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />theres nothing wrong with it<br /> <br />the behavior was ripped straight from bo3s BT files - this &quot;is&quot; exactly how they work in the 3 maps they were used for in bo3<br /> <br />and solo v co-op has absolutely no baring on how this works<br /> <br />ive also tested this on co-op on stevies map heavily - that definitely isnt the case</p>
