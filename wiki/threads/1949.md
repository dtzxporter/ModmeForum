<p>Reply By: Scorpiolo<br />I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;d said he didn&#39;t mind people sending them privately to each other when everyone was arguing with him about removing them. Whether he likes it or not, he released them as a public asset so it&#39;s not really his call anymore, if he didn&#39;t want them used he shouldn&#39;t have released them in the first place.</p>
