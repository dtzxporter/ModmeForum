<p>Trying to make &amp; import a custom hand animation, but I have no idea where I&#39;d put it. I am using the Pack a Punch Knuckle Crack as a replacement, so I was gonna look in the files to see where that was, but I did a search in the BO3 Root and it says there&#39;s no matches anywhere.</p>

<p>alot of things are loaded in the game, not in the actual mod tools.</p>
