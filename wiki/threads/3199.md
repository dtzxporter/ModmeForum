<p>I&#39;ve only ever created scripts for my own maps. How would I make custom scripts run on stock maps? I created a mod and added a script parse tree to the zone file and wrote my script, but it didn&#39;t execute in game. For maps, you have to add the init to the map&#39;s GSC. But I don&#39;t have the GSC for every stock map to make it run do I?</p>

<p>There is a way to run the script automatically as long it&#39;s setup properly in zone, etc. Not sure if it will work for mods though.<br /><br />Make sure this is in the script that you wish to run in the stock map:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
#using scripts\shared\system_shared;
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br />Then add this underneath all of the usings, inserts etc:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
REGISTER_SYSTEM_EX( "name of script here", &amp;__init__, &amp;__main__, undefined )
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
The &quot;__init__&quot; and &quot;__main__&quot; are just functions used in your script so make sure they are setup. If you are using one of them and not the other make sure to set the one you&#39;re not using to &quot;undefined&quot; (without the speech marks obviously).<br /><br />Hope this helps.</p>
