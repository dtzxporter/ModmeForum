# Stupid question, can you "control" the same ent on the server and client side?

<p>Title pretty much describes it. I&#39;m getting into client side scripting, and so I don&#39;t know a lot about it(getting better, I can actually make stuff happen haha).<br /><br />In radiant there is a drop-down option on an ent called &quot;client_server&quot;, so I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s a one or the other type situation correct?<br /><br />Thanks in advance for answering my obvious question.</p>

<p>Client side means you can only reference it in csc and each player has their own copy of it<br /><br />Dynamics in cod are individual, each person sees ragdolls and stuff differently ( you may see a zombie body somewhere, player 2 might see it elsewhere )</p>

<p>you can with clientfields if you want something preprogrammed to happen to the ent in csc</p>

<p><blockquote>you can with clientfields if you want something preprogrammed to happen to the ent in csc<br /></blockquote><br />Thats what I have been using, I just wasn&#39;t sure if there were better options for certain things that you need to use server and client functions on.<br /><br />For example in Panic Center(the map from waw) there is a vent you have to shoot to get to the pharmacy.<br />I wanted to make it an easier find, so I used DR to give it an outline. However I needed to be able to &quot;launch&quot; it as well.<br />When I tried launch and physicslaunch in csc it crashed. I assumed that&#39;d be the case because scriptapi said it&#39;s a server function(sorry if &quot;function&quot; isnt the proper term, I don&#39;t know all the scripting terminology). However some &quot;server&quot; marked functions still work in csc so I tried it out. I couldn&#39;t get DR to work on dynamic ents so that was out of the question(plus now that I know dynamic ents are instanced, that wouldn&#39;t have been an elegant solution)<br /><br />I ended up doing some jank method that deletes the client side model at the same time as I launch one from the gsc side, but I feel like there has to be a better way to do it.</p>

<p><blockquote>It “crashed” because the model didn’t have a valid physics preset set in ape<br /></blockquote><br />Does the physics preset only matter if the model is set for client? So if I set a valid physics preset in ape, I can launch it in csc?<br />I can use the same model in gsc, use physicslaunch, and it works just fine.<br />Like I said, I am very new to messing with csc haha. I&#39;m also not an expert by any means when it comes to scripting in general lmao.<br />I appreciate all the help by the way.<br /><br /><blockquote>Does the &quot;outline&quot; work for you?<br />Just im trying to put a &quot;outline&quot; to the players always &quot;activated&quot;, but i have all the body painted and i only want a &quot;outline&quot;.<br /></blockquote><br />I quite literally spent 50+ hours trying to get them to actually outline and not be a solid color LMAO.<br />I figured out one reason(not sure if its the only reason) is because sitrepscan_enabled is set to SITREP_FRIENDLY_ONLY /4.<br />I couldn&#39;t figure out how to overwrite the sitrepscan because it was set in _zm.csc. Setting it in my own script wouldn&#39;t overwrite it for anything.<br />then Mike mentioned in his powerup delay that you can in fact override any script by removing them from the patch first.<br /><br />After that I just changed the sitrepscan_enabled from:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
self oed_sitrepscan_enable( SITREP_FRIENDLY_ONLY );
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
to:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
self oed_sitrepscan_enable( SITREP_BEAST_MODE_AND_FRIENDLY );
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br />I haven&#39;t done any testing in co-op just yet, so I don&#39;t know if changing that affects the player outlines already set.<br />If worse case I can just remove the player outline when they are far away/through walls.<br />I had to also rip _bb.gscc with hydra to allow my map to compile with _zm in my zone.</p>

By the way, if you have the cellbreaker of Spiki, look the &quot;brutus_helmet.physpreset&quot; in APE and look the CSC, maybe can help you with your model, idk.</p>
