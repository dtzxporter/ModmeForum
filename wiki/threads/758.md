<p>Thread By: jjakob9696<br /><p style="text-align:left;">As the title of this topic says, i need to play an animation on a zombie.<p style="text-align:left;"></p>i analyzed some treyarch scripts and they use this to play an animation by script {% highlight php %}{% raw %}
SetAnimStateFromASD

{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br /> but i don&#39;t know how use it because doesn&#39;t exists in bo3 api reference.<p style="text-align:left;"></p>I tried using Animscripted and obviously i setup the Animtree (UseAnimtree in script and .atr) but the zombie clears all animations for a moment and after that it continue to plays the previous animation it was playing but the animation that i want to play doesn&#39;t start :-[LEFT] </p>I also tried using SetAnim but nothing...<p style="text-align:left;"></p>Does anyone know the solution to this problem?[/LEFT]</p>

I am releasing my Brutus extremely soon. I have people beta testing right now. Just hang tight till my public release and you will be able to see how I did everything </p></p>

<p>Reply By: dkamasta<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Hi Nate,</p><p style="text-align:left;">I used already so much in my hardcore mod from you, thnx a lot.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cant wait for the brutus release, will it be possible to add him in a mod?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cause I saw SAM A. his robot could be randomly spawned in with spawn coordinates, will this be possible for brutus.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Or only with a map and a spawn point?</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">why I ask, I have shared my hardcore mod code completely with makecents, cause he is working on difficulty menu.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He can do a way better job then me offc. I am just amateur.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But my goal and I am big fan of realism mod with Fire boss rounds. My goal is a difficulty mod for all maps with extra zombies and bosses.</p><p style="text-align:left;">And many custom guns with your custom weapon drop hehehe.. loving it. Sound of your powerups are awesome now btw.</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">Moto Moto (dka_masta)</p></p>
