<p>Reply By: Doodles<br />So yeah, after a lot of research and try and error, I had managed to make it work, kind of, but, a guy named ZoekMeMaar, sad that, I can set a new path for the vehicle whenever I want like this:<br />    n_path_start = GetVehicleNode( &quot;new_node&quot;, &quot;targetname&quot; );<br />    level.vh_train AttachPath( n_path_start );<br />    level.vh_train StartPath();<br />So yeah, problem solved!</p>
