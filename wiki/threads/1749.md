<p>Thread By: ProRevenge<br />I am using Rico&#39;s fantastically ported weapons into Bo3, and have added a BF1 firesound to one of them, but what they lack is the rush of air you can hear after a shot which can be heard with native Bo3 guns, this is the case for any ported weapon, is it possible to add this &quot;flux&quot; sound? Is it done in Soundalias somehow, or some sort of script? Because it sure isn&#39;t done in the firesounds themselves in Bo3 or Wraith would pick them up</p>

<p>Reply By: Hero115<br />Or<br /><br />Get the sound in Audacity &amp; Merge it, just put the sound you want in the end. So it plays after the shot.</p>

<p>Reply By: ProRevenge<br />That&#39;s not how BO3 Handles it though, in stock BO3 maps, guns actually have differing fire sounds if they are shot inside or outside, and the air rush I&#39;m describing is only heard outside, ive no idea how these effects can be done in customs though</p>
