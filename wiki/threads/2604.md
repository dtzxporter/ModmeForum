<p>Any geo errors, etc. from cod2map usually indicates bad geo in your map, since the compiler merges faces, you need to ensure your map makes it as easy as possible for it to do its job, and overlapping brushes, bad patch work, too many verts on a patch, etc. can error.<br /><br />The errors don&#39;t usually give much info only to those at Treyarch who can debug it, so you&#39;ll need to check over your map and manually check your geo.</p>
