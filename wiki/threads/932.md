<p>Thread By: MJPW<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Hi I was curious of two things and seeing if it works: Changing FX in-game and changing sounds in-game.</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">Here&#39;s what happens, after my Easter Egg is completed there&#39;s a flash of light and the snow becomes embers and the announcer changes to be more demonic. I think it would be fantastic if it can be pulled off!</p></p>
