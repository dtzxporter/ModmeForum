<p>Thread By: apechound<br />I have had trouble trying to export a downloaded FBX file from Maya to xmodel_export using the CoD Maya Tools, but it just gives me an error message saying there are no meshes to export.<br /><br />I then tried to export it as an OBJ, then import it and export it, which worked, but then when I put it through Kronos, it gives me an error message that says something along the lines of some files could not be exported.<br /><br /><br /><br />Does anyone have any idea how I could work around this?</p>

<p>Reply By: Scobalula<br />What are you selecting? CoDMayaTools will export whatever meshes are selected.</p>
