<p>Hi guys, I&#39;m making a zombies map in the Whitechapel area of East London for a Jack The Ripper themed zombies map<br /><br />This is my first zombies map and I have spent the last 2 days working on it<br /><br />I am very bad at scripting so am welcoming help from members of the community! It would be cool to have custom zombies from the 1800&#39;s period with some cool models<br /><br />Here is my work so far. I have started the chapel, the pub, the factory, the grave yard, the river and the houses. also the road<br /><br />Here are some screenshots of the map inside radiant<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/G3fdUcH.png"><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/YH0XB6h.png"><br /><br />Here is my floor plans i drew on paper<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://imgur.com/8a871422-6b91-4cc2-bd26-d265e361a91e"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/ijcBpjR.jpg"><br /><br />Here is some real life photos for reference<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://www.dowjonesarchitects.com/media/images/Christchurch_Spitalfields_Nov_2015_DG_03.width-1400.jpg"><br /><br />I think it would be cool if you could go round to pick up clues around the map to try and solve the murders, maybe even play as jack the ripper himself, or the police force, but the town has been over run by zombies, just an idea<br /><br />its my first zombies map and its very fun to play around in, its very open with wide areas so its liberating<br /><br />i would be able to would love to incorporate maybe all the places the murders happened, including mitre square etc<br /><br />i would love some help and feedback, thanks alot guys</p>

<p>Good start! I would recommend that you take your time when making each building. Yes it&#39;s a good idea to layout some brushes just for general layout planning, but when you start making the buildings, it&#39;s best to just add some detail while you are at it. You don&#39;t have to fully detail it before moving on to the next building, but you will save yourself a lot of time detailing your map if you just add some detail as you go.<br />If you haven&#39;t watched them, Blackjackjohnny made an amazing detailing series back in the day for WaW, most of the concepts still apply for bo3. It&#39;s definitely worth watching when you have the time.<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIkU1xPvgfJQgo0w3o1PzVw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIkU1xPvgfJQgo0w3o1PzVw</a></p>

Most of his relevant tutorials are about patchwork and detailing. There are quite a few good youtubes that do/did the normal tutorials.<br />Like i said, it&#39;s a good idea to lay out brushes to get an idea of how you want the layout.<br />I was more or less just pointing out the buildings need some work. You said this was your first zombie map so I was assuming you had never done any modding. Some first time mappers would&#39;ve called that church a &quot;finished&quot; building. :p<br /><br />I guess I just do layouts different than normal mappers haha. Mine are normally just brushes in rough sizes/shapes of the buildings, and thats it. I don&#39;t bother adding windows, roofs, etc untill I&#39;m making and detailing that building.</p>
