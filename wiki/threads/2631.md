<p>Correct me if I am wrong, but sounds like you&#39;re asking about how to make zombies spawn in the areas that you are currently in, and not the other areas of the map? If so, then you need to &quot;zone&quot; your map. Zoning your map basically divides your map into smaller areas that the game can identify better for actions like zombie spawning. You can learn how to zone your map here: <a href="https://wiki.modme.co/wiki/black_ops_3/basics/Setting-up-zones.html">Zone Tutorial</a><br /><br />Or, if you&#39;d rather watch a video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht1bu0zBqWA">Zone Video Tutorial</a> &lt;--- This video shows you everything you need to know about zones, doors, and zombie spawns.</p>

<p>The Giant has a cleanup script that kills zombies that are greater than a certain distance from players and respawns them.<br />There is a nice tutorial here: <a href="https://wiki.zeroy.com/index.php?title=Call_of_duty_bo3:_ZM_Cleanup">https://wiki.zeroy.com/index.php?title=Call_of_duty_bo3:_ZM_Cleanup</a></p>
