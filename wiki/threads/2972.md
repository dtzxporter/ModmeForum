<p>Hi, so this is a big question. I&#39;m trying to change the model from a weapon, especifically the &quot;RW1&quot; from Advance Warfare (from TheSkyeLord), and what I&#39;m trying to do is the following:<br /><br />1. Change the weapon world and view model, so the gun is the same but the model different.<br />The model I&#39;m using is this one:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.400.png' | relative_url }}"><br /><a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/the-service-weapon-control-c7686eddf56c43ab9c3f778dad6073c4">https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/the-service-weapon-control-c7686eddf56c43ab9c3f778dad6073c4</a><br /><br />At this moment I&#39;m using as both world and view model. The wm looks ok but the vm is the one mess up:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.402.jpg' | relative_url }}"> <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.401.jpg' | relative_url }}"> <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.403.jpg' | relative_url }}"><br /><br /><br />2. I want to change the reload animation, so it looks more according to the weapon, but I don&#39;t really know how to do it.<br /><br />3. I want to change the idle animation so it looks more like this:<br /><br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/controlgame/comments/cx9y02" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br />Basically move the model of the gun itself, but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s even possible.<br /><br /><br />So my question is, does anyone can help me pointing in the right direction?<br />Like any tutorial you know, any tip or maybe if you have time to help me that will be cool.<br />Any help I&#39;ll really, really appreciatted.<br /><br /><br />Thanks :D</p>
