<p>So I&#39;ve got this lil easter egg going where this pose manipulated model is sat on a toilet. All I wanna do is delete it from the toilet. I&#39;ve basically finished the scripting but the pose gets messed up when i make it script_model. when its a misc_model its fine though. any idea how to fix this? I&#39;ve included images to show what I mean when I say it messes up in game.</p>

<p><blockquote>Make a anim in maya and play it on him<br /></blockquote><br />That&#39;s not the way I want to do it. I know theres a way to make a model scriptable but im not sure how. Also don&#39;t own maya and not willing to learn how to use it &#175;\_(ãƒ„)_/&#175;</p>
