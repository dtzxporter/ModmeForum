<p>Thread By: TCM<br />How would you go about changing this, I found the chest in _zm_magicbox.gsc<br /> <br />I found the 950 price there tried changing it but nothing<br />Added it to my main map as well and no change.<br /> <br />Nevermind got it I believe<br /> <br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
level.zombie_treasure_chest_cost = cost;
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />EDIT: nevermind that didn&#39;t seem to make a difference as well.</p>

<p>Reply By: MyNameIsNobody<br />try editing the cost in the box prefab in Radiant (by selecting it and right clicking prefab&gt;enter prefab and checking both red boxes that are stuck inside each other, finding the price and changing cost) as well as changing the script cost to the same maybe maybe? Try that but remember everything you changed in case it doesn&#39;t work so you can return it to normal. (prefab and script). Hope this helps someone, let me know if it works! You may not even need any script changes but idk im not experienced with scripting at all. Try it with one box location fon a test map first, add in your box prefab etc....</p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />yeah you can change the price of the mystery box by editing the prefab in radiant. You can even set different box locations to have different prices if you want.</p>
