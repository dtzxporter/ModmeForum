<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">-------------------------------------------------------------</span><br />Re-texture, change, add, remove or animate the models<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">--------------------------------------------------------------------</span></strong><br /><br />Look into the model&#39;s folders to see if I included a &quot;.<strong>MAYA</strong>&quot; file (<em>unless its Wolfenstein</em>)<br />If I indeed included &quot;.<strong>MAYA</strong>&quot; files that mean you can change everything from the models.<br />You can change the <em>texture, color, shape, add/remove things, animate it</em>. so just<br />keep that in mind if you are into that fetish.<br />

<p>How have you gone about porting all these? Did you set them all up yourself manually or did you do some sort of automated way? Are all the materials set up properly with the proper PBR? Do all the models have proper collision and LODs? <br /><br />Your demonstration spoilers don&#39;t actually contain any demonstrations.</p>

I use a program and a script that puts materials and textures together, but the gloss and other elements have to be done by hand which takes time :)<br /><br />and also I deleted the screenshots because of the situation mentioned before so I will put some pictures on there after I&#39;ve fixed the materials</p>

<p>I have a few helpful tips for you.<br /><br />1. Move the downloads from mega to mediafire - theres a 5GB download limit per day for some users, so it will literally take a few days to download these models.<br />2. Remove all of the xmodel_exports. literally costing yourself (and us) space/shit we dont need. This is 50% the reason as to why the downloads are so massive.<br />3. Remove all images and create a global images folder. Again, literally costing yourself (and us) space/shit we dont need since multiple models use the same exact textures/assets. This is the other 50% as to why the downloads are massive.<br /><br />You can cut these downloads in half if you follow what I&#39;m saying. I don&#39;t mean to be a dick, and don&#39;t take this the wrong way. Just trying to help you out for the future.</p>
