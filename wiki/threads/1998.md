<p>Thread By: BrandonTr3<br />Im trying to port the corpse models to bo3 from WAW but the links for mod tools 1.0 are all down and i cant find any page with all working links for all versions. I downloaded the &quot;all in one&quot; mod tool pack for waw but its only v1.4 and has missing images from the corpse models. I was able to export the corpse models to obj but the images are nowhere in waw&#39;s directory which tells me they are missing.Can anybody link me working links for each version? Thank you<br /> <br />EDIT: I have found wokring links but textures are missing and i dont even see them in the mod tools.</p>

<p>Reply By: BrandonTr3<br />Thanks for the reply and i did convert it. I ported the corpse model using tom xmodelutils and it wont read the images in it, and its because the files still dont exist.</p>

<p>Reply By: ByPsicoYT<br />No...<br />You&#39;re supposed to run converter.exe to get the &quot;missing&quot; files.</p>
