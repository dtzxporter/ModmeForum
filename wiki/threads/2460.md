<p>Thread By: Scobalula<br />So if you&#39;ve exported from Infinite Warfare you&#39;ll know the daunting process of separating the normal maps, ao maps, etc. from the tons of images that come with models.<br /> <br />So, since I like automating stuff, here&#39;s a tool to handle it. <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://aviacreations.com/modme/emoticons/kissing.png"><br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/yC3AUeN.png"><br /> <br />To use:<br /> <br />1. Group images into their own folders in a base folder with no other files/folders, like <a href="https://i.imgur.com/z4EWQF6.png">this.</a> The folder <br />name will define the prefix of the images, i.e. weapon_fmg will result in weapon_fmg_n, etc.<br /> <br />2. Set the image format to write to in settings.ini (default is PNG).<br /> <br />3. Enter the directory of the main folder.<br /> <br />4. Let her do her job.<br /> <br />Notes:<br /> <br />* Accepts/Writes: TIFF, TGA, PNG, DDS*, JPEG<br />* Alpha channels are maintained for _CS.<br />* Potential for Access Denied Errors with files that already exist, so delete them I guess.<br />*DDS Cannot be written to.*<br /> <br /><em>**While I do take suggestions, this tool was made for my needs and it does what I want it to do, I only released it as there&#39;s no point in keeping it to myself. If you want to modify the app, feel free, the Py file is there. Make a pull request if you have a suggestion.**</em><br /> <br />Example:<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/wvaC6Cw.gif"><br /> <br /> <br />Download:<br /> <br /><a href="https://github.com/Scobalula/IW7ImageSeperator/releases">Download</a></p>
