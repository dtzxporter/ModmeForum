<p>My end goal is to reimagine the original 4 maps, but with any improvements I&#39;ve seen talked about over the years, plus emphasising the main component of each level. I&#39;m currently working on nacht, and I want to make it as scary as I can, and make it a map focussed fully on the zombies themselves. Barebopnes, so no perks, or pack a punch.<br /><br />I&#39;ve learned how to color corrent maps, so here&#39;s a test of making it black and white, except for red.<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.644.png' | relative_url }}"><br /><br />It works really well when there&#39;s isn&#39;t much red light. (Note the zombies&#39; eyes).<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.645.png' | relative_url }}"></p>

<p>This looks really cool! Excited to see where you take this in the future.</p>

<p>I agree with Hatsune Blake!! Looks like you&#39;re off to a pretty good start man &#128526; I always thought it would be cool for those older maps to be expanded and opened up a bit so that you could go outside and explore the surrounding areas some. I remember a WaW Nacht reimagining that had a couple outdoor areas and that map was a big hit at the time! I think it would be pretty awesome to see something like that with these too haha. Maybe even totally restylize the maps with a different look but the same layout plus a couple added areas so it adds a refreshing new map feel to them. Jungle, winter, future, part of a city block.... the list of possibilities is almost endless!!<br /><br />I have this tool that lets you rip maps from old CoD games and turn it into a static model. Once you&#39;ve done that then you can basically use that static model as a stencil in radiant and draw brushes and patches to fit the static map model then delete it and texture/model the map as you see fit. (I have this companion tool that is supposed to convert the map models into editable .map files, but I could never get it to work sadly :( lol) I could send you the map model exporter if you&#39;d like so you can get a 1:1 scale size on all of the map reimaginings and take out all the guess work on distancing and size. Definitely helps save yourself some time during the mapping!</p>

None of the original sizes of anything fit to the grid though, 7 wide walls, 117 wide hallways, etc, so I rounded some numbers. I&#39;ve kind of stopped working on it for now though, because I&#39;ve had a LOT of messages that I&#39;m just doing another Nacht remake like everyone else, and there are certain things I want to do, that other, bigger modders have told me I won&#39;t be able to do at my skill level, such as make the hud black and white, which was pretty demotivating.</p>

<p>I&#39;m with the other people here. Re-making old maps is not a way forward. (I&#39;ve remade so many MP maps..so trust me here). If you&#39;re going to remake something, use it as a learning tool for yourself, then make the next map an original. Anyone can copy\modify an original, there&#39;s not much skill involved in it.</p>

I remade BO2 Standoff from MP into a jungle/swamped themed zombie map years ago on WaW and people <strong>LOVED</strong> it!! Just read the comments section on the page lol (Currently bringing it into BO3 too :sneaky: It&#39;s called Shinda Numachi in case you want to try the WaW version!!) So there definitely can be some appeal to a map remake/reimagining if done right. You just have to have the creative vision to make it a reality!<br /><br /><blockquote>I found the old map model and used it as a prefab to remake this map from the ground up after posting this.

That&#39;s just part of life. I look at mapping like this: I get to build a custom zombie map all for myself, exactly the way I want that I get to play on for the rest of my life, and if some people happen to like it when it&#39;s released? All the better! If not? Well, I wasn&#39;t really making it for them to begin with anyways so their opinions will keep &#129335;‍♂️&#128514; Do what makes <strong><em>you</em></strong> happy man haha.<br /><br />As for the skill level thing, they might not be wrong... but if you take a look at the files and mess around with them a bit, you&#39;d be surprised of what you can learn and how surprisingly easy it can be! Most people are self taught with some assistance from other&#39;s along the way. A lot of the things involved aren&#39;t super difficult, but more time consuming and knowledge based than anything. Definitely requires some experimenting, but that&#39;s part of the fun &#128526;&#128076;</p>

That parts not the issue. There’s no way to “work out on my own” what the names of scripts are, or the names of files I’m looking for to edit to do what I wanted to do. I’m starting to work on a new idea but it’s going to be kept secret for now.</p>
