<p>Hey all!<br />I&#39;ve been searching online for how to make the teleporters like on Moon where all players must stand on it to teleport. The only results I&#39;ve found were for WAW so I was wondering if you guys can help.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t how to do it, but I guess you need NSZ Teleporter and modify the script to remove the option of link the teleport (Press F to link teleport and all of that). Then, you&#39;ll need to change the trigger from the teleport to a &quot;trigger_multiple&quot; and activate the option &quot;need_all_players&quot; from Radiant.<br />I don&#39;t know how to program at all, but I guess is something like that.</p>
