<p>How i have to set up the _clientids.gsc in order to change the starting weapon on any of the stock maps? I only find tutorials on how to do it in Custom Maps.<br /><br />Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Don’t mess with that<br /><br />Copy one of the power up scripts to your mod in the same directory and add it to your zone - it’ll override the stock one so you can hook from there</p>

Sorry for asking maybe this question that may be stupid, but how i integrate it properly?<br /><br />startingWeapon = &quot;&quot;;<br />weapon = getWeapon(startingWeapon);<br />level.start_weapon = (weapon);<br /><br />This is the function that changes starting weapon if i&#39;m not mistaken, i&#39;m trying to set it into into my mod folder/scripts/zm/_zm_powerup_full_ammo.gsc which is one of the powerup gsc from root bo3. I already added it to zone<br /><br />Thanks Harry for the help/patience with a newcomer in modding like me by the way</p>

<p>Your setting it first, the map is then setting it back after<br /><br />Have to delay it<br /><br />In the end I think I just did a callback when you spawn, took the gun they get back off them and force gave my own<br /><br /><br />The line you’ve done will also be in mapname.gsc - which is happening later</p>

How i should do it?<br /><br />Thanks again for helping since i&#39;m still learning the fundamentals of scripting with mod tools</p>

<p>Nice<br /><br />Remember it’s a different weapon on dlc5 maps so you would need to handle that</p>
