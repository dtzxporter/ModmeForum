<p>Thread By: MrZ0mbiesFanatic<br />I am trying to create the zombie blood powerup from Origins, but I am confused on how to correctly call the script for my map. I looked at the mini gun powerup for reference and created both the .gsc, and the .csc version for my powerup, and added the #using lines to my mapname.gsc, and mapname.csc and added the scriptparsetree to my zone file, but I am getting clientfield mismatch error when loading the map. <br /><br /><br /><br />If anyone has added any custom powerups to their map, can you tell me how you did it step by step?</p>

<p>Reply By: Reckfullies<br />Clearly something went wrong when adding code to your mapname.gsc and csc because that is where this error is coming from.</p>

<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br />My experience with clientfield mismatch results from you registering a clientfield that doesnt exist. It has happened to me when making a custom perk, but I haven&#39;t messed with custom powerups quite yet so I cant quite say how to do it. Its on my long list of things to do lol</p>

<p>Reply By: MrZ0mbiesFanatic<br />Ya I finally got it to work. That is what happened Nate, was trying to register a clientfield, and I made one for it following the same pattern as it is in powerups.gsh, but apparently that is one of the scripts that CAN&#39;T be edited, so it wasn&#39;t updating my change.</p>
