<p>Thread By: FrozenDragon<br />Is there a download link anywhere to get a pack with die rise models? Looking around for one but none to be found anywhere.</p>

<p>Reply By: modric<br />would port like crazy if I actually owned any of these maps, but I dont mod enough to justify spending $15 on die rise and another $20 on bo2</p>

<p>Reply By: modric<br />I own bo2 and bo1 and season pass for both on ps3 as well as both on xbox one plus 2 map packs on there so save it... Im not begging for a hand out as I have plenty of models but if people have them I would like to see them posted for the modding communities sake. If activision actually put dlc on sale I would consider it</p>
