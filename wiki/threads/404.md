<p>Thread By: SwanK<br />My map is seperated into 5 areas. Each area is only reachable through a jump pad, but when you use the jump pad, zombies cant find you if you arent in the first zone. <br />As soon as i go back to the start zone they can follow me, but not in others. Another issue is that they spawn in the wrong zones. How can I make it so that they only spawn in the players zone??<br />Any help is appreciated, this thing is the only thing delaying this map!</p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />First you need to connect your islands with a monster_clip or normal clip so the zombies can walk over to the other islands (even if you&#39;re using teleporters for them). You also need to add at least 1 pathnode from the entity browser to each island.</p>

The path nodes did in fact work, but the islands are too far away for them to walk too, it would take forever. Is there a way to make them despawn when in a zone without a player?</p>

<p>Reply By: D-2-K<br />you could just make your zombies teleport from 1 to the other so they dont have to walk the distance ;)<br /> <br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_86tluzY5E8" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
