<p>Im having trouble publishing my map on the workshop. I think its because of a vac ban I got on bo3 ( gave myself lots of cryptokeys, dont worry I wasnt cheating headshots or something ). Can I just log out of that account and upload the map on my new account? Or are the files in my bo3 root connected to my current ( vac-banned ) steam account? I dont mind buying bo3 a second time.</p>

<p>Your files are not linked to your account but whats the trouble? What errors do you get? I don&#39;t recommend blowing 60$ if you can fix it.<br />Also i don&#39;t blame you for hacking cryptos, the black market is bullshit.</p>
