<p>I&#39;m trying to turn lights on and off by changing between lightingstate1 and lightingstate2 with SetLightingState()<br />I&#39;m running this exactly =<br /><br />SetLightingState(2);<br />ls = player GetLightingState();<br />IPrintLnBold(ls);<br /><br />output &gt; 2<br /><br />But the light which is set to only be on lightingstate1 doesn&#39;t turn off.<br /><br />Edit: So while looking at radiant I noticed my ability to switch between states was locked (weird), after an hour of searching I found that my skybox only has an ssi set for state1, I set it&#39;s ssi for state2 and bing badda boom it works. Why the ssi isn&#39;t set for each state by default is idiotic, radiant pisses me off more each day</p>
