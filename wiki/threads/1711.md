<p>Thread By: Chef_<br />I&#39;ve used Wraith to export the animations and models and I&#39;m not sure what to do beyond this point to put them in Black Ops 3.</p>

<p>Reply By: DTZxPorter<br />First off you need maya, specifically a newer version for use with the rig. (<a href="http://aviacreations.com/modme/forum/topic.php?tid=83">http://aviacreations.com/modme/forum/topic.php?tid=83</a>) Follow the instructions and import the weapon model binded to the hands. Once binded save the scene as a new file name. You must then drag and drop the wraith anims for the weapons 1 by 1 and export according to the Rig&#39;s specs. We will have tutorials soon.</p>
