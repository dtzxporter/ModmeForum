<p>Ok, lets say I have BO4, and I would like to port a BO4 map to BO3. How would I go about doing that?</p>

<p>At the moment, you can&#39;t, the tools haven&#39;t been developed to rip the maps from bo3 onwards, but Scobalula is always stuffing around with it, so it&#39;s really only a waiting game I guess. <br />I&#39;m sure if someone slung money towards scob or dtzxporter, i&#39;m sure one of them would do it.</p>

Games before BO3 work, and you can just straight up rip maps from like WaW, BO1, or BO2?</p>

<p><blockquote>Yes but the map is one huge model<br /></blockquote><br /><br />It is one huge model. It&#39;s not optimised, it doesn&#39;t completely rip textures properly, and has no collision on it at all. Can not be used in COD as is without heavy modification for COD</p>
