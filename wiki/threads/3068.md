<p>Okay, so I&#39;ve used both of these programs, and neither of them have a &#39;Manage GDT&#39;s&#39; button. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re outdated, or I need to apply some specific settings. But I have no idea why they don&#39;t. If anyone could help me that would be great. I need some models from Buried and Tranzit.</p>

<p>No, all you can manage is their output (below), all other settings all internal. The older versions output separate GDT&#39;s, now it&#39;s just one massive one. You need to think outside the box here to do bulk models. Make a template, and copy it to all the new names. The images won&#39;t be set up, but it&#39;ll give you the materials.<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.512.png' | relative_url }}"></p>
