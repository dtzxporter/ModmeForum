Yay!<br /><br /><li>A new currency<br /><br /></li></li></li></li></li></ul>In the future I plan on making many more script-features that will change how you play zombies. The custom currency for example, is a big feature in the map that I will expand upon.<br /> <br />I&#39;m primarily a scripter, rather than a mapper, so I wanted to make a map that is heavy into scripted features.<br /> <br />If anyone wants to help me with this map (including mappers), or just stay tuned for updates, you can join the discord created for it <a href="https://discord.gg/mbmPuZB">HERE</a>.<br /> <br />Also, if anyone can come up with any good names, you can post in the comments below, I&#39;m open to suggestions.<br /> <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Others Working on the Map:</span><br /><ul><li>Zombiekid164<br /><br /><li>Renegade<br /><br /></li></li></ul></p>
