<p>Thread By: Abnormal202<br />I don&#39;t want to do this, but I feel like it is my obligation to do so.<br />I want to make it <strong>very clear</strong> that <strong>I DID NOT MAKE THIS. THIS WAS MADE BY HARRYBO21. PLEASE DO NOT CREDIT ME.</strong><br /> <br /> <br />Then, Why am I uploading content that isn&#39;t mine?<br /> <br />Well if you haven&#39;t noticed Harrybo21 has taken down all his content (he made <strong>quite</strong> a lot for this community) for certain reasons that still are a little unclear to me.<br />I asked him to put it back up, but he seemed very resolute in his decision to take it down, and did not want to put them back up. He did however say that he didn&#39;t mind if someone else hosted it, as long as he didn&#39;t have to. I would put up the conversation as proof, but it seems he deleted that topic.<br /> <br />So anyways, because I care about this community, and hate to see so much work go to waste, here is HarryBo21&#39;s stuff:<br /> <br /> <br />&lt;h2&gt;<span style="color:#ff0000;">Mod note: The redistribution of these files is against the wishes of the creator and has been removed. Any further incidents such as this will also be removed.</span>&lt;/h2&gt;<br /> <br /><strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">Also, if anyone else has any of Harry&#39;s Old stuff lying around that I don&#39;t have here, or perhaps newer versions of the ones I have here, please leave a comment or message me with the link and I will put it in the topic. Let me know if you can&#39;t host forever, and I will host it for you.</span></strong><br /> <br />If Harry ever changes his mind and puts his stuff back up, I will take this down right away.<br /> <br />Lastly, I know he may not be giving you his content anymore, but you should still credit HarryBo21. Part of the reason he took his stuff down was due to lack of credit and appreciation for his work.</p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />Oops forgot to change the title. Should be HarryBo21&#39;s Perks V1.4 and HarryBo21&#39;s Weapon Ports V1.3, or Perhaps just HarryBo21&#39;s Assets.</p>

They are good ports and i respect him for porting them just want to make that clear but i don&#39;t think he should take something away from the community because i made a stupid comment. I dont know if i want to upload the v1.4 for the weapons tho. It would take a while to upload. That&#39;s one thing i do the most, I own up to my own mistakes.</p>
