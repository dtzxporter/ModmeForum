<p>Thread By: XxCAFxX<br />Hello all! I&#39;m uploading all of the assets I ripped from Buried, as a thank you to all of the wonderful members of this community <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://aviacreations.com/modme/emoticons/smile.png"> I&#39;ve tried my best to fix all missing/bugged textures, but i&#39;m sure there are still some present. be sure to put all of the contents of the zip into your root/model_export/black_ops_2 folder. Credits go to Porter for the wonderful Wraith tool &amp; 3arc for the original assets &amp; Export2Bin. Enjoy! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />              <br /><a href="https://mega.nz/#!FZEFVSqL!UZhl2T2TLiCvtyeVS8g-soL7d6ihY0s-oUKD9GpqLA4">Download</a></p>

<p>Reply By: ItalianMilkMan<br />Was having trouble, models were not working. Found out that you actually need to place the models in root/model_export/black_ops_2/xmodels</p>
