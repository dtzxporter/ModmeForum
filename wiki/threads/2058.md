<p>Thread By: johnwillard45<br />EDIT: I solved it, it was because of an alias error.<br /> <br />I am having this error with my map. I can not find anything on it nor did I find anything that reveals to me what the issue is. I had this issue previously when I made a door and I resolved it by deleting it. Now after adding some stuffs and creating a debris buyable, I had the same error once again. So I backtracked and I believe I removed everything, but I still have this issue. Does anyone know what this error means?<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/D8MeCri.png"></p>
