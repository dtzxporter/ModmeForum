<p>Thread By: ii_R3cKY0urS3LF_x<br />hi guys.. I have one problem. <br /> <br />I ported some fortnite models I wanted to use and they ported fine... but when in radiant they appear in the model browser with the textures on but then if u place the models in the map they go black but if I then go in to game preview mode in radiant they have the texture??<br /> <br />im very confused... any ideas as to why it wont show without game preview on?</p>
