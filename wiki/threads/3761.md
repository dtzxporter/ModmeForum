<p>I&#39;ve been trying to make a custom Black Ops 1 Hud but I don&#39;t know how to code it, if anyone can show me how to make one or make one themselves it would be appreciated<br /><br />The link is for a PSD file of what it would look like<br /><br /><a href="https://mega.nz/file/Qd5wlLqT#DDTEDIapbPpm2RWlEv3kuwn9tS8Sd77jlG7w_FqCZTs">https://mega.nz/file/Qd5wlLqT#DDTEDIapbPpm2RWlEv3kuwn9tS8Sd77jlG7w_FqCZTs</a><br /><br />Edit: Sorry for posting in the radiant forum I&#39;m new to the site</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t download the file, but are you trying to make a bo1 style hud in bo3? Or a custom hud in bo1?<br />If you are tyring to do it for bo3, you could try this tutorial.<br /><br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KIXYxYd29NY" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br />This is probably not the &quot;best &quot; way to do it, but it should work.<br />Edit, I should add, i THINK(not for sure because I&#39;m pretty clueless when it comes to LUA) all huds are done in LUA now. So if you want to do a full custom hud, you&#39;ll probably need to learn LUA.</p>
