<p>Thread By: durtybrown94<br /><p style="text-align:left;">I dont know what happened. I added Brutus and shootable easter egg today and it all tested properly. I added some rooms and then tested map and now i load in with a gun, no grenades, no round indication, and no zombies will spawn in. I do not get an error compiling the map. There is only one &quot;start zone&quot; volume with all spawner linking correctly. I&#39;ve rolled back all my scripts back to this morning where everything was working correctly and deleted my brutus and shootable easter eggs and the issue is still unresolved. Ive got over 40 hrs into this map and really dont want to scrap. Please help.</p></p>

<p>Reply By: durtybrown94<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Thank you so much for the help, it was the zombie actor I must have deleted. Now I have to reinclude everything I deleted but better then scrapping the map. Thanks again!! I dont know how to mark this post resolved, but Im all set moderators.</p></p>
