<p>Thread By: mathfag<br />How to spawn something (trigger radius) in front + 50 units of something that is moving and constantly changing direction (example zombie).<br />Can&#39;t use radiant and Link the trigger.</p>

<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br />This was a tough one that took me a while to get right. I believe I got the logic from a script from WaW. Here is the code: <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
function get_point_in_front(distance) //self is the entity you want to get the point in front of. returns the point in front of the entity
{
	fire_angles = self getPlayerAngles();
	fire_angles_forward = anglesToForward(fire_angles);
	fire_init = self.origin + (0,0,50); // added 50 to make it slightly off the ground
	return fire_init + vectorScale(fire_angles_forward, distance);	
}

/*
Example: 
org = player get_point_in_front(50);
*/
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
</p>

fire_angles = self.angles;


and

org = self get_point_in_front(100);
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />I still have no idea how the code works</p>
