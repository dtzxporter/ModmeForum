<p>Thread By: TheHolyCarrot<br />Hello all. If you&#39;ve seen my other post about maya having some errors, you&#39;ll know I&#39;m relatively still new to this. There is a similar topic about this, but it&#39;s a different error. Upon importing certain animations (more specifically, the lean animations) they appear to have wrong translations/rotations? It happens throughout most of the cod games I extracted from (IW, MWR, Ghosts, BLO3). Looks like this <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://ibb.co/hCtXOc"><a href="https://ibb.co/hCtXOc">https://ibb.co/hCtXOc</a>. Any ideas as to what&#39;s going on?</p>
