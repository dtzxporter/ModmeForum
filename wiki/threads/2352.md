<p>Thread By: modric<br />Since there is no public file that I know of for a buildable Pack-a-punch, I decided to release mine. It is a revised version of Shinged&#39;s buildable power switch script, found here <a href="https://ugx-mods.com/forum/index.php/topic,13439.0.html">https://ugx-mods.com/forum/index.php/topic,13439.0.html</a>. Please remember to credit both me and Shinged if you use this script. Also if you have access to any of the original tranzit buildable pap part models feel free to send them to me for use with this script, as my script is using default pack a punch parts from BO3.<br /> <br /><a href="https://mega.nz/#!VTYjkILQ!b3kBYrubaqF6aZD4pNgv6J_QBgK_GkKPQro-Kh_oxH8">https://mega.nz/#!VTYjkILQ!b3kBYrubaqF6aZD4pNgv6J_QBgK_GkKPQro-Kh_oxH8</a></p>
