<p>I&#39;m releasing a pack that I have been working on for years, and a whole few model rips that I paid over $200 on hosting to my cloud drive. And I&#39;ve been working hard all day and all night for these assets, all going across for all COD4, WAW, BO1, and BO3 with custom scripts and FX.<br /><br />Here&#39;s a download.<br /><br />The link has been redacted due to somehow being replaced with an ACTUAL Indian training thing, in this case, a dox. Sorry to all that clicked on the link to expect the initial Rickroll prank on April 1st (that was, before) to find out it was a chart with Indian stuff later on.</p>
