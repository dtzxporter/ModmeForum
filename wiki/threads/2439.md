<p>Thread By: SpSSdy<br />Right, I understand that we don&#39;t have anims yet and we have only just gotten models but I thought if I made it before we get anims then people can port guns ASAP. Of course, without the use of anims im not entirely sure if there will be any problems but with testing from rotating joints there seems to be no issues. Exporting anims should be normal. Might have to make your own ADS anim. If you use this rig please credit the people bellow.<br /> <br />Update: Fixed problems with the conversion rig. Created a shelf so that it is alot easier to export anims. Created a readme file so you know how to use it.<br />Update 2: Fixed even more problems, had help from other people to fix other bugs I had missed. Works ingame now.<br /> <br />Credits (CREDIT EVERYBODY HERE OTHERWISE I WILL REQUEST YOU TAKE YOUR MAP/MOD/POST DOWN):<br />ThomasCat - Created Conversion Rig<br />DtzxPorter - Legion<br />JerriGaming - Providing Models<br />ElTitoPricus - Testing, Bug Reporting, Initial ingame test weapon<br />DamianoTBM - Testing, Bug Reporting<br /> <br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CAlqt2NFNy0" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/uth3Vql.png"><br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/SmPJ1yB.png"><br /> <br /><a href="https://gfycat.com/colorfulfirstgreatwhiteshark">https://gfycat.com/colorfulfirstgreatwhiteshark</a><br /> <br /> <br /><a href="https://mega.nz/#!5kQWFA5B!BY7aJ1zas1WIgmI3Qo70ALk5O58-BHpnvA9rcjac5qo">Download</a></p>
