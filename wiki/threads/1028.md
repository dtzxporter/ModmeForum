<p>Thread By: soul-toktzt<br />I found in the zm_perks the function with the animation but when i turn it into comments, it didn&#39;t &quot;disable&quot; the animation.<br /> <br />Anyone knows how to disable it?<br /> <br />(Like when you buy it, you get it instantly, without you actually drinking it.)</p>
