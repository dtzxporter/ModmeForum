<p>Thread By: rossdaboss<br />Dead Men Tell no Tales is a map that i have been working on for about a month now. the theme that i&#39;m going for is an old abandoned pirate town thats been taken over by the undead. Note that this is a very very early work in progress right now as all i have done is the starting room. Its going to be a very large map with a lot of easter eggs and custom stuff. I&#39;m planning on having weapons from waw, bo1, and bo2 in it. I&#39;m fairly new to mapping so any helpful suggestions on what i can do to improve this map are appreciated! <br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://images.discordapp.net/.eJwVzMENwyAMAMBdGAAntjAm2yCCCFUoCNxXld2r3gD3NZ95m8NcqmMdAGddqc_TLu0zlmxL7-XOcdRlU28QVWO6Wn7rAhTxQm5nloDkAgvQJuhpD-wdIRLLBrX9m9co5vkBw28h5g.r4C02b2Y6MaitmMZty2JHUuo4S0?width=957&amp;height=410"><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://images.discordapp.net/.eJwVzNsNwyAMAMBdGAAH84jJNoggQhRqBO5X1d2r3gD3Ue_5qENdImMdAGdbmeepl_BMtejKXJ-SRls6c4ckkvLVy0sWINFO1psQKKL1MRDYjXC3iORcJGeMd9D6v7lHVd8fw14h5g.MKSpiEGk1NRiKPl3gzOL5YIaXBg?width=957&amp;height=410"><br /> <br />Here are some questions i have on this map right now:<br /> <br />Does anyone have any helpful texturing or detailing tips to make the map look a little better?<br /> <br />what round music do you guys think would fit the theme of the map the best? (i was thinking of gorod krovi)<br /> <br />what pap camo should i have in this map?<br /> <br />I have the 4 staffs from origins in my map (big thanks to harry bo21) and i was wondering if there was any way to switch the model of them to a katana too fit the pirate theme more.(so they would shoot and reload the exact same way but the model would be different).<br /> <br />How can i edit the zombie models in the map to be pirate zombies?<br /> <br />where can i change the pap names and ammo counts of some of the guns in my map?</p>
