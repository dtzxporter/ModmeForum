<p>Howdy, I&#39;ve been having some weird problems with (what I think is l3akmod) where my game will just break completely. Like the game just won&#39;t launch. I think it&#39;s a problem with l3akmod because I can&#39;t think of anything else I&#39;ve done that would completely screw up the entire game. I had this problem recently, uninstalling and reinstalling everything didn&#39;t even work. The only way I can fix it is by uninstalling steam and reinstalling everything. If anyone else has had this problem/ knows a better way to fix it, please let me know. Thanks!</p>

Now that you say that, I did install a gun pack and a perk pack...do you know how to fix it/ how to prevent it in the future? It would be very annoying to have to uninstall everything every time I wanna add another gun or something lol. Thank you!</p>

<p>Update: something is seriously fucked up. I had to uninstall and reinstall steam again, then do the same thing with the games. It worked for about a day, then without changing any settings at all, it just stopped working again</p>
