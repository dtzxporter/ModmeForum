<p>Thread By: Zombier<br />I set up a mystery box which starts at random for the first time in my map, but since all mystery boxes are started randomly, I want to randomly start &quot;chest_4&quot; from &quot;start_chest&quot; in it.</p>

level.random_pandora_box_start = true;
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />will make it pick a random location and according to a treyarch comment, you can set the KVP &quot;start_exclude&quot; on boxes you dont want to be allowed to pick<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
//start_exclude is a KVP, just need to add start_exclude 1 to the box script struct to exclude it from the initial random box selection
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
