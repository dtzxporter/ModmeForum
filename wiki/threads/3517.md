<p>I am currently scripting a custom perk, and I need to access the damage of the weapon&#39;s bullet for balancing purposes. (The perk is functional, as it only needs an int to work).<br />This is because the perk functions when the player is firing.<br />Providing a static value ruins the slow-firing weapon archetypes.<br />Basing it on inverse mag size means that PaP&#39;d weapons are worse off then their base counterparts.<br />Using actor damage callbacks makes it tons more effective on headshots (not intended), causes a recursive effect where it ends up spreading amongst a horde instead of inflicting groups, and becomes catastrophically more potent with collaterals.<br />Hence it is important that the damage value is directly from the weapon<br /><br />Is there any way to directly do this?</p>
