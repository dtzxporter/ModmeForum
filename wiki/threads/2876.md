<p>Hi, so I&#39;m trying to show and hide a door. Basically when you touch the trigger_multiple, a door will show, and after 2 min the door dissapear. The problem is, the script doesn&#39;t do anything :(<br />I&#39;m using script_multiple, script_model and script_brushmodel so I think that&#39;s not the problem. Here&#39;s my script:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
//Boss fight
level thread boss_fight();



//Boss Fight
function boss_fight()
{
    trig = GetEnt("boss_fight_trig","targetname");
    bfdoor = GetEnt("bf_door", "targetname");

    //Hide door
    bfdoor Hide();

    trig waittill("trigger",player);

    //Boss fight
    bfdoor Show(); //Show door
    level flag::set( "spawn_zombies" ); //Start zombie spawn
    player playsound("music_BW"); //Start music
    wait(120); //Fight time
    bfdoor Delete(); //Delete door
}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br />Any help would be really really appreciated :(</p>

<p>So what exactly is the problem? Does the door never show up? Never delete? or what?</p>

I&#39;m trying to make them dissappear after the 2 minutes</p>

I&#39;m assuming either you&#39;re not waiting the full two minutes or there&#39;s a typo in one of the targetnames</p>
