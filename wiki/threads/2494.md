I don&#39;t want to make a script for you until you get that done, because in my opinion that would be the hardest part of all this.</p>

Black Ops 3 has a pretty impressive FX editor in radiant, you could probably make your own green smoke FX just by playing with the FX already in Black Ops 3.</p>

<p>Reply By: Fil he Modder<br />ok man, i made a lite version of the fx, it&#39;s green and pretty nicely represents gas, not as much as i want it to, but it&#39;s getting there, so will you help me with the script now so i can see if it&#39;s possible to make a button cause the gas to appear? :)</p>
