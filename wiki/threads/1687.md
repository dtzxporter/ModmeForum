<p>Thread By: LegacyNm<br />In general, I can&#39;t get ads up and down animations to work with seanim files. I still have some old .mel animation files that work fine with animations and I am able to aim down sights in game perfectly fine but when it comes to porting ads animations with the seanim files, none of the weapons I&#39;m working on actually have a full ads........ any thoughts or possible fixes? I&#39;ve exported tag_torso and tag_view and even tried other combinations and It just wont budge. <br /> <br />With the seanim ported ads animation in game, the ads just zooms in. The gun moves a little to the left but doesn&#39;t actually aim down the sights.</p>

I&#39;m porting the M60 currently and just can&#39;t get the ads to work out of everything else. I have more weapons waiting from bo1 and can&#39;t move forward because they give me the same problem.<br /> <br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a/ZlBDeeT" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /> <br />That&#39;s what happens when I ads. I exported tag_view and tag_torso and results are repetitive.<br /> <br />Also I&#39;m using MAYA 2017. Should I be using a different version?</p>

I&#39;ve been exporting both tag_view and tag_torso. just tried it with the commando and its doing the same thing with the ads. <br /> <br />Take a look <iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a/ZlBDeeT" frameborder="0"></iframe><br />Any Other Ideas?</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />Looks like you selected hierarchy<br /> <br />this has been the same since waw<br /> <br />this has nothing to do with seanim/Mel - whatever mistake you are making would happen the same</p>

<p>Reply By: LegacyNm<br />I am at the understanding that this isn&#39;t a seanim problem. This would be about my 27/28th weapon ported into bo3 but my first 2 with the seanim files.<br /> <br />I did not select hierarchy, I can assure you that I know what I&#39;m doing regarding what tags to export them with but perhaps something changed with the seanim files?<br /> <br />Did the method change from when it was once .mel files when exporting ads animations? I have been inactive for about a year and maybe missed a memo about it.<br /> <br />After I export the viewmodel from the game, I clean it up and then use the bind script provided with the exported files to bind the weapon. Then I save it and open the conversion rig and drag the weapon in, put j_gun under tag_weapon_right and zero out the xyz in the translate section of the Tranform Attributes area in the Attribute editor. Next I import the seanim file using the option provided by the SE Tools plugin.<br /> <br />Then after checking the animation works, I select the standard tag_view and tag_torso <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>without hierarchy</strong></span> -&gt; Call of Duty Tools -&gt; Export XAnim -&gt; fill in the frames 0-12 or whatever it is then export it out. <br /> <br />Am I missing something new?<br /> <br />There&#39;s also one thing I noticed between the .mel and .seanim files with the ads files with the gun <iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a/2PxBJpA" frameborder="0"></iframe><br />Is that normal, how the gun doesn&#39;t move position with the seanim files?<br /> <br />Thanks for the responses.</p>

<p>Reply By: LegacyNm<br />So I found the issue. It wasn&#39;t me or how the animations were imported or exported. It was the modtools not linking the updated BIN files and keeping the old stuff. Pretty much means that the mod tools weren&#39;t reading that the new Animated.bin file was updated and overwritten and because of that it would keep the old broken animated file everytime. I just fixed the issue by selecting a different .BIN file in APE and reselecting the new one. <br /> <br />Thanks for all the replies :)</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />Nothing is different about either seanim - or it being bo1<br /> <br />for a start bo1 and bo2 use exactly the same rig</p>
