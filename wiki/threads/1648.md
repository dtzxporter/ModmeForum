<p>Thread By: Scobalula<br />Currently porting the M2187 from IW and all went well apart from the strap, essentially it&#39;s weighting is gone and it&#39;s just binded to tag_weapon once in-game, only the 2 rings are binded...<br /> <br />Before exporting to XMODEL_EXPORT:<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://my.mixtape.moe/ceszfj.gif"><br /> <br />After going in-game and exported via<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://my.mixtape.moe/hymugn.gif"><br /> <br />In APE when viewmodel is used as preview model:<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://my.mixtape.moe/sisspm.gif"><br /> <br />In game of course it just rotates with the model.<br /> <br />Here are the source files:<br /> <br /><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/aabr8vbbdk22cbg/model_1887.rar">Download</a> <br /> <br />I had a similar issue with a pair of viewhands from Ghosts that I converted and ChainSAW&#39;s bullets after subdividing but the chainsaw fixed itself after I rebinded them and the viewhands fixed itself when I modified CoDMayaTools to not write &lt; 0.1 bone influence. <br /> <br />I have not modified the model in any way, simply from Wraith --&gt; Maya --&gt; Bind --&gt; CoD Maya Tools --&gt; ExportX --&gt; APE.<br /> <br />I have checked the log also besides the usual stretching texture, etc. no Weighting/Influence warnings/errors.<br /> <br />This however doesn&#39;t want to repair itself...I&#39;d appreciate any help, if I can&#39;t fix it I&#39;ll just remove the strap. Thanks!</p>
