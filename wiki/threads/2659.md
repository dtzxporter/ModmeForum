<p>Hi all,<br /><br />I was just curious if anyone knew how to do this but the mystery box by default will randomly generate a selection of up to 32 guns. I know in BO4 it&#39;s much higher and maybe in other places idk. I was wondering if there was a way to increase this limit?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />- Ping</p>
