<p>Thread By: The Black Death<br />I am calling them using _load. When I was using just clientids and calling a gsc (before I needed a csc), it worked completely fine, but since calling them via _load I cannot load any map (it crashes). I&#39;ll pastebin my scripts below.<br /> <br />_load.gsc<br /><a href="https://pastebin.com/033V4iQR">https://pastebin.com/033V4iQR</a><br /> <br />_load.csc<br /><a href="https://pastebin.com/9fgpHGUk">https://pastebin.com/9fgpHGUk</a><br /> <br />zm_moreguns.gsc<br /><a href="https://pastebin.com/r8eRX217">https://pastebin.com/r8eRX217</a><br /> <br />zm_moreguns.csc<br /><a href="https://pastebin.com/7fii410h">https://pastebin.com/7fii410h</a><br /> <br />The stuff that moreguns.csc is doing is not being kept (I basically copied a csc from one of my maps)<br /> <br />Besides that, I&#39;m intending on using these scripts in order to add weapons in a mod to the box etc. I&#39;m investigating the scripts further still.<br /> <br />Any ideas?</p>
