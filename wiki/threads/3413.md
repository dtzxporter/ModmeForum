<p>Is there a comprehensive list of FX that can be played with PlayFX() and PlayFXOnTag() either online or in the black ops 3 game folder. I know of &quot;zombie/fx_powerup_grab_red_zmb&quot; because I saw someone use it in a tutorial but I wanted to try and find one for like a burst of flames.<br /><br />I also was wondering if there is a list of sounds playable with playsound()?</p>
