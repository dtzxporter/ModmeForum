The forum structure here changed slightly so the original links need a slight change.  My viewers are good and tend to let me know when a DL link isnt work (lol).  I will go through all 30 of my videos and double check.</p></p>

<p>Reply By: tbone-5<br /><p style="text-align:left;">i did not know if this is worth reporting nate or if you will update or fix it, but when you have two or more normal base powerups, with two or more of your powerups the shaders become to far left they don&#39;t match up with the normal powerup shaders only when there is more than one, would this be easy to fix? or something that&#39;s harder than it looks?</p></p>

<p>Reply By: Wild<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Hey, don&#39;t know if this is something that can be fixed ATM but I have noticed something while testing my map the past few days. When you are in zombie blood the zombies can not deal damage to you. However, even though that is the case if you get close to the zombies they will swing at you anyway. Like it said it still doesn&#39;t deal damage so it&#39;s not that big of a deal but if you get close they can still swing and surround you so when you get out of zombie blood it can make it easy for the player to down. It&#39;s very minor since like I said they don&#39;t do damage and you basically have to be touching the zombie but it&#39;s still a little bug.</p></p>

I will try to take a look at some point, but I dont care to dig deeper atm. Thanks for the report!</p></p>

This makes for some interesting results sometimes and is most noticeable by people running in settings greater than 1080p</p></p>
