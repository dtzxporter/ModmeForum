<p>Thread By: modric<br />I have an area of my map that would be better off to use zetsubou round sounds than the sounds I have in the rest of my map. The area is teleported to, so I could wrap it in a trigger multiple of course. Is it possible to have the round change sound assets be different in the trigger multiple area?</p>
