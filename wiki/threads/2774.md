<p>Yes...<br />1.. You need to rip all the textures from either the IWD files (then convert IWD to DDS, DDS to TIFF or PNG (since BO3 doesn&#39;t support DDS), or use Greyhound to rip straight to PNG or TIFF.<br />2.. You (should, but don&#39;t have to) separate Decals, Normals, Occlusion, Specular and Diffuse into separate directories. All these images should be in a subdirectory of \BO3\texture_assets<br />3.. You need to create a MATERIAL name which contains the Diffuse, Normal, Occlusion and Specular for EVERY SINGLE TEXTURE.<br />4.. You need to save the GDT which contains all the Material names in the same directory as the Images, or one directory below.<br />5.. You then need to set up each material as a what it is supposed to be.. Is it a solid texture, Transparent or  a decal ? Is it Metal, Rubber, dirt etc, is it terrain or a wall ?<br /><br />It is a long, long process. Good luck !</p>

<p>the IWD files can be opened with WinRar<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.177.png' | relative_url }}"> <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.178.png' | relative_url }}"><br /><br />The IWI files need the program IWIXDDS<br /><a href="https://iwi-x-dds.software.informer.com/">DOWNLOAD IWIXDDS</a><br /><br />Once it&#39;s a DDS, you will need to Convert it again to a PNG. You can do this with NOESIS under the TOOLS &gt; BATCH PROCESS window.<br /><a href="http://www.richwhitehouse.com/filemirror/noesisv4406.zip">DOWNLOAD NOESIS</a><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.180.png' | relative_url }}"><br />Change the OUTPUT PATH, Input Extension, Output Extension, then click Folder Batch and select where the DDS files are located.<br />Click Export and Voila! It&#39;ll take a while..there&#39;s alot of files....so maybe do it before you go to bed\go to work so you can leave the pc do it&#39;s thing.<br /><br />Then it&#39;s a matter of importing all the materials, creating GDT&#39;s. All I can suggest is make one Material with a dummy name, dummy diffuse map, dummy normal, and save it as a template.gdt. Create a batch file\program that copies this template.gdt to all the material names you have.</p>
