<p>Thread By: Sazuzaki<br />I&#39;ve been trying to make a private *mod* that adds WWII weapons (ported by TheSkyeLord) to the mystery box but after looking at every single tutorial, wiki, and video i could find, nothing worked. Im not very experienced with modding,  so don&#39;t bash me if i did something stupid.<br /> <br /> <br />If you need certain pictures or videos just say something in the comments, otherwise, feel free to talk to me on discord @Sazuzaki#0576</p>
