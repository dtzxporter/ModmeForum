<p>Thread By: Immens3_Modder<br />Hello, i was wondering if it would be possible to enter a zone using a script not a trigger so that when the player teleports they are transported to the other side of the map and in a different zone (kinda like moon) and i&#39;m not sure how to do that can anyone help?</p>

level flag::set( flag );
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
