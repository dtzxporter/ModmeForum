<p>I&#39;m trying to get a hold on the base textures of the Origins Box, Pack-a-Punch, and anything that doesn&#39;t include the base textures besides the red and green textures, bumpmaps, and the black and white bases. I need the colored ones to port completely and I can&#39;t seem to find any resources that can help with this. Does anyone know the issue or what I need to do to get them?</p>

<p>Because the white “is” the base and it’s tinted</p>

<p>So the black and white images are actually what you see in-game, no filter or system that converts them to those colors? Because it doesn&#39;t seem that way, and we&#39;re missing a piece that gives the proper stone color to the Origins Box and Origins Pack-a-Punch. If they are run through some sort of system that converts them to the right colors, let me know so I can get the proper ones on my end please.</p>

<p>Albedo tint...<br /><br />you can literally dump the set up materials for bo3 with hydrax and see for yourself</p>

<p>I&#39;ve figured it out, and all of that wasn&#39;t the fix, nor related to the issue I was talking about. I said I only got a hold of the green and red textures, the black and white, and the light maps/bumpmaps. I was missing the legitimate textures to texture the models with. I&#39;ve figured it out, I needed to use Greyhound and not default Wraith Archon which then gave me the missing textures. Thank you for trying to help, but I did it on my own.</p>
