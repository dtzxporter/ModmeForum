<p>Thread By: gamesniper99<br />Hi! I have recently played a map that I like on workshop (Clash Royal Zombies) and the map has this quick round but the rounds overlap. I tried to contact the creator and he has not answered. Is there anyone who can help me?<br /> <br />-Link to map: <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=785188990">http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=785188990</a><br /> <br />Thanks! <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://aviacreations.com/modme/emoticons/smile.png"></p>
