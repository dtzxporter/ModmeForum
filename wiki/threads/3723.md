<p>Is it possible to have a dynamic model fall to the ground by a trigger? for example have the player hit a trigger that causes a painting xmodel<br />on the wall to fall? How would i do this?</p>

<p>You can just add a dynamic model in radiant(open entity browser/dyn/model). it will float in place where you put it, and will react when shot. It wont fall by just bumping into it(at least it didn&#39;t when I just tried it).<br />You can put a trigger multiple in front of it if you want  to set a flag or show a model/trigger/whatever, after the trigger is hit.<br />you can also add a clip that gets deleted by the trigger, if you are trying to make a secret entrance.</p>

<p>How well do dynamic models sync in 2-4 player games? A lot of instancing goin on?</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t tell you because the map i&#39;m making it for is singleplayer only, just one player character.</p>
