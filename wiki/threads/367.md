<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />make sure you&#39;re using the model<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
p7_fxanim_zm_factory_robot_head_smod
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />and make sure that the kvp &quot;siege_anim&quot; says<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
p7_fxanim_zm_factory_robot_head_sanim
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
</p>

Or can i?<br /> <br />Maybe with having multiple ones and hide, show, hide show, hide, show,... But i tried that with something else to make it look like it&#39;s spinning around, but it&#39;ll basically flash.</p>

Basically you hang your lamp (dyn_model) on a rope (entity browser) and then add a &quot;playfxontag&quot; to the model in a script. Make sure that its a light fx</p>

I&#39;ll try it once i finished this area i&#39;m working on :)<br /><br />PS. Do you know if there&#39;s a file somewhere with all the functions you can use in a script so you can see how you have to script something??<br />I&#39;m trying to trigger an explosion FX with PLAYFX, 1.5 seconds after a trigger_use, but i haven&#39;t been able to make it work yet.</p>
