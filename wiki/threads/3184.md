<p><blockquote>What is the error/when does it occur<br />Does it compile fine? When does it crash<br />Need some more info my dude<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Launcher shows no errors and the game crashes upon loading the map, consistently when the fps is at 29</p>

<p>Have you ever modified the new map template?<br /><br />Can you post the full launcher linking text just in case?</p>

<p><blockquote>Launcher shows no errors and the game crashes upon loading the map, consistently when the fps is at 29<br /></blockquote><br /><br />maybe try setting the priority of BO3 to high<br />If not, does your pc have enough ram to run games?<br /><br />there’s a few things in game that can cause your game to crash. If you have implemented any scripts from modme or anywhere else, maybe look into whether or not there something you have missed that’s causing itto crash</p>

Out of absolutely no where, it began working again flawlessly. I guess if you resort to smashing a bunch of buttons stuff works out lol. Thank you all for your suggestions</p>

<p>Yup, Einstein said that lol. Now that I think about it, I actually did uninstall scobs linker so I think Harry is right. It is all appreciated!</p>

<p>Hey there, the no info crash i am familiar with it happens if there is something you put in radiant that doesn&#39;t exist or in some cases you might not of installed something correctly this could be a simple typo or a model or something that just doesn&#39;t know its there also on script side<br />Example <br /><br />Function main()<br />{<br />Code here <br />Makes sense but it also fucks up because <br />You did something like <br /><br />While (1)<br />{<br />Print 1<br />No wait = bad because it just constantly prints 1 <br />}</p>
