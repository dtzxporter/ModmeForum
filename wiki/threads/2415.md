<p>Thread By: The Black Death<br /><em>&#39;Aside from the fact that I&#39;m still alive, none of this surprises me. Technology got stronger, but we got weaker. We built computers, robots, whole unmanned armies, but no one ever asks: &quot;What happens when the enemy steals the keys?&quot; When the things they built to keep us safe are turned against us, that&#39;s when they figured it out: They&#39;ll always need men like us, those who are willing to do... what others cannot.&#39;</em><br />- Frank Woods (Black Ops II Trailer)<br /> <br /><strong>Introducing the Black Ops X Character Pack</strong>, bringing you high-quality ports of the four Blackout characters (Mason, Reznov, Woods, Menendez) completed with voice lines. (aside from Menendez as there wasn&#39;t much selection)<br /> <br /> <br /><strong>Current version: </strong>v1.5<br /> <br /><strong>Screenshots:</strong><br />First Person<br /><br />

<p>Reply By: HEYOU<br />Hello! So I&#39;ve recently started mapping and I&#39;ve been following tutorials. I tried to add your ported characters into my map but they won&#39;t load in. I CP all of your files 3x times now and re-done all of the steps and copy pasted all I needed for them to work properly but the thing is, I still spawn with the same default characters. Has this been a problem to anyone else who used these playermodels or am I the first having this issue?<br /> <br />EDIT: Only sounds work, Dempsey for example is using Mason&#39;s voice.<br /> <br />EDIT N&#186;2: I found the solution for the problem and you forgot to mention that you have to delete this line from the assetlist/core_common &quot;customizationtable,zm_character_customization&quot; in order to work!<br /> <br />Thank you for this awesome mod anyway!</p>

You can get Greyhound (a fork of Wraith) here: <a href="https://github.com/Scobalula/Greyhound">https://github.com/Scobalula/Greyhound</a><br /> <br />You will also need to run this program beforehand <strong>AND DO NOT RUN IT WITH BATTLENET OR BLACK OPS 4 OPEN</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/Scobalula/T8ZoneRipper">https://github.com/Scobalula/T8ZoneRipper</a></p>

<p>Reply By: The Black Death<br />Version 1.5 is now released.<br /> <br />Changes:<br />- Updated the heads to use official weights.<br />- Updated the heads to use their release textures (except Menendez&#39;s face, as his beta version of that looks better).<br />- Updated Reznov, Woods &amp; Menendez to use their release model changes (this can be reverted, but will not be guided).<br />- Fixed a missing step in Instructions.<br /> <br />Download:<br /><a href="https://mega.nz/#!KcdHSKwB!C5gy1-t-pVYTPuJtQjKNYBRbBYFYuiCU44jxHTsyoLU">Download</a> <br />(link fixed, my bad)</p>
