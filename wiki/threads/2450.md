Made in about 20-30 Minutes, this tool will save you countless hours on re-uving BO3 guns to work in WaW (Or even if you want to re-UV to save on asset room in BO3 when tools come out).<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />To install this tool, just follow these steps:<br /><br /><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/h8XNbit.jpg"><br /><br /><br /><br />Now click this link:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://pastebin.com/mf0czEfH">I AM A LINK</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />and paste from this pastebin into this:<br /><br /><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/VCIaFV8.jpg"><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline"><em><strong>How to use:<br /><br /><br /><br /></strong></em></span>Simple select the UVs and and depending on your image (1:2, 1:1), click where you want to move it, for example, if you&#39;re image is in the top right corner of a 1:1 image, then under square image, click &quot;Top Right&quot;.<em>Optionally if the UVs are outside the image (done to prevent overlapping and to make them easier to view) and you can select them, and use the &quot;Move UVs to center&quot; to move them to the center, the button may have to pressed more than once if the UV is for example, 4x outside the image.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></em>You should have a general understanding Maya and editing UVs, etc. how to select them and so on. Please don&#39;t ask basic questions like &quot;how to select UVs&quot;, &quot;how to use it&quot;, etc. these will be ignored.<br /><br /><br /><br />Example with 1:1 image:<br /><br /><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/2c7831f5f9f7eb4346a65953fc17b58a.gif"><br /><br /><br /><br />Note: In some cases after moving the UVs to the image, you&#39;ll notice they stick out a bit, due to Treyarch intending on it tiling to the other side of the image, simply select the points and move then just to the inside of the image.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />You do not need to credit me for using this tool.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Released under GPL3, feel free to adapt to your own projects!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
