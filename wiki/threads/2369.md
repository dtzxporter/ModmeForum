Thanks you so much, but there are some bugs to fix if I can tell u:<br /> <br />- Sliquifer, when the zombies collide with the liquid they stop cheasing you and stays on idle animation.<br />- Acid Gat instakills you if the explosion touches you.<br />- The SOE wonder weapon, only explotes, and it doesn&#39;t kill the zombies, it makes them invisible and immortal zombies.<br /> <br />This are the onmly iusses tht I have found, but, the pack is the best I have seen, but if you fix that will be gorgerous. :D</p>

Thought, you might knowing the answer for this as you have more knowledge then me. <br /> <br />thanks again for the support. My first map will come one of these weeks after years of fails from me.

<p>Reply By: D-2-K<br />Hi Harry quick couple of questions  (  well maybe 3ish  ) <br /> <br />1. If i get the upgraded OIP and have an upgraded staff is the punch supposed to take on the attributes of the staff not sure if this was a feature you have added to them or just a strange bug ? have reproduced this several times so if you would like a video that can be done <br /> <br />2. I know this will become &quot;a thing of the past&quot; when your template is released but is there an order in which to install your  packs ie weapons perks shrieker  etc i only ask as i have a fresh install of the tools 1st pack i installed was perks tested everything worked great but after installing this gun pack the bottle open, gulp and bottle smash sounds stopped working also found that reinstalling the perks fixed this but for some weird reason the hells retriever or hells redeemer 1st raise sounds don&#39;t work and if i throw either of them i get a lasting buzzing sound its not bad but when wearing headphones its annoying and can only be heard if i stand still it goes away when i move (i even changed my sound card thinking it was a hardware issue but alas getting the same results with on-board and separate card) <br /> <br />3. and finally , the soul box open and close animations have stopped working with this new gun pack i haven&#39;t tried reinstalling that yet but was all working with older version i believe was  2.3.0 and i am using the full install and instructions from the Wiki as i know you stated that the  &quot;soul chest code is only included coz the one inch punch borrows code from it, the full code ( with sounds etc ) is on the wiki&quot;<br /> <br /> <br />and again sorry for being a bloody pest and thank you mate</p>

When the build is done, the gun flies into the air and says that the gun is in the mysterybox. The bad part, it removes your gun and if you had a trowing axe ( the axes you have included ) it will be gone as well. was this already updated or what should i change? ( i also know that this gun is the mysterbox, even if you didn&#39;t make it. it also shows an alert when a zombie is slipping away.

<p>Reply By: meepmeep<br />Good morning harry. <br /> <br />i have 2 bug reports. one of them is the hint string error and the other one is an invincible staff. ill explain what i did to reproduce the bug. <br /> <br />1. i have the 4 staffs placed next to stairs that goes up to another area. while a buddy of mine was stuck on between the stairs and the staff, the staff won&#39;t be visible after building it while the second player is stuck between it.  Staf does not return. We tried this a second time and had the same effects but the 3th time, the staff just spawned. ( ill let u know what staff it is later today. not home a.t.m ) <br /> <br />2. the dragon shield upgrade hint string is broken that should showing &#39;&#39; place the shield here to be upgraded &#39;&#39; just as the pap if you know what i mention with it. However, the keys about how to attack are fixed. <br /> <br /> <br />Now, i have a question related to the staffs. You can upgrade them, but how would i be able to add this option in the map? i had the upgrade pillars placed but they didn&#39;t worked as they should be working. The hintstring was showing but nothing else happened actually. Also, i might be addicted to zombies my whole life.. but i had never heard of a revive staff before?  i saw that part in the files as well for &#39;&#39;step one&#39;&#39; for upgrading the staffs... but i&#39;m clueless. Could u send me a youtube link or some quick tut how to add this with the stuff you have included in the prefabs? Thank you in advance.<br /> <br /> <br />a great modding day ahead harry, keep up the good work. Respect <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://aviacreations.com/modme/emoticons/cool.png"></p>

<p>Reply By: GCPeinhardt<br />I found out how to fix the Retriever/Redeemer sounds<br /><br /><br />Go to t6 sound alias and comment out this line:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
#wpn_tomahawk_incoming,,,black_ops_2\wpn\tomahawk\tom_incoming.wav,,,GRP_WPN_LFE,,SECONDARY,,,BUS_FX,,,,,,80,80,0,1000,1000,,,,,3,oldest,,,1,1,,,,,,3d,wpn_all,,NONLOOPING,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,YES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
That will fix the buzzing noise and the weird sound when you pickup a different tomahawk or open and close the menu<br />And add this line in:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
zmb_tomahawk_first_raise,,,black_ops_2\wpn\tomahawk\tomahawk_first_raise_1.wav,,,GRP_WPN,,SECONDARY,,,BUS_FX,,,,,,80,80,0,1000,1000,,,,,3,oldest,,,1,1,,,,,,2d,wpn_all,,NONLOOPING,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,YES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
