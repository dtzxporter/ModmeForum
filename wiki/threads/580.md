<p>Thread By: apechound<br />So I have an idea for a map and wanted to use some in game models to replace the perk machines that would still work in the same way, but they would obviously not look like the perk machines. I was wondering if I would have to either have a script similar/identical to the one of the machine or whether I&#39;d just be able to replace the model. If I were to need a script, how would I go about writing it as the closest I come to coding is basic Python xD<br /><br />Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Reply By: DTZxPorter<br />Well actually, take a look in &lt;perkname&gt;.gsc and in the top OR in &lt;perkname&gt;.gsh they have defines which link to the name of the model to display :)&lt;/perkname&gt;&lt;/perkname&gt;</p>
