<p>I can&#39;t seem to figure out how to use both Atmosphere and World fog. My map is on a mountain, which is curve patch heavy, and I don&#39;t want to create more lag than I have to to get the full effect. I created an atmosphere fog that looks very beautiful and fits the map perfectly, but I also need a world fog to block off the terrain. Is there any way I can use both types of fog at once? Thanks!</p>
