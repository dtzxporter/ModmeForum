ee_fx = GetEnt( "ee_fx", "targetname");
ee_fx Hide();
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />After the EE has been completed you can &quot;unhide&quot; the FX so it shows where you placed it by: <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
ee_fx Show();
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />Haven&#39;t tested it, but let me know if it works =)</p>
