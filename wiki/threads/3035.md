<p>I&#39;ve ported the sickle and galvaknuckles to Bo3, but can&#39;t figure out that animation when you purchase it. It&#39;s the first_raise anim where you inspect the weapon and then put it away like the bowie knife. I have the animation, I just can&#39;t figure how how the script calls it on the viewmodel. Any help would be appreciated!<br /><br />Video for Reference: <iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rg9XahnOfYk:9" frameborder="0"></iframe> (0:10 - 0:13)</p>

<p>Sickle has already been done.  But for the wall buy you need the target name to be sickle_upgrade or tazer_upgrade and you need to have two seperate weapons, the normal one and a flourish one. Theres a sickle link on here somewhere. Look at it and see how its done.</p>

<p>This is the post i was thinking of however you can see the download is down. I myself was planning on doing the galvaknuckles but i dont have much time or knowledge required to get them 100% anytime soon. Hope you can get them working and best of luck to you. DM me on discord and i can help you get to where im at. <a href="https://forum.modme.co/threads/sickle-from-ascension.2424/">https://forum.modme.co/threads/sickle-from-ascension.2424/</a></p>

Not sure what type of weapon it should be, but I tried bullet and melee and there are issues with both. I added you on discord Ultra#0253.</p>

<p>For anyone wanting a solution consult <a href="https://forum.modme.co/threads/galvaknuckles-wallbuy-script.914/#post-3538">this thread.</a> Except the function at the bottom of the script is unnecessary. Also have your flourish weapon as a grenadeweapon, and change the idle anims.<br /><br /><a href="https://forum.modme.co/threads/galvaknuckles-wallbuy-script.914/#post-3538">https://forum.modme.co/threads/galvaknuckles-wallbuy-script.914/#post-3538</a></p>
