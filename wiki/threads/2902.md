<p>Hey all,<br /><br />My friends and I are interested in making custom voices for our characters at lots of different scenarios. <br /><br />For example, we’re intending to do the voices for basically everything that the regular characters say. <br /><br />So, are there any tutorials or links for an ENTIRE step by step process to do this? There seems to be no tutorials on YouTube or on the web for something like this, but I know it’s possible.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />The_bibba_boy</p>
