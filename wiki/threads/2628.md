<p>How&#39;s it going guys, first time I&#39;ve done a tutorial so let me know what you think. In this tutorial I&#39;m explaining how to add a radio into your map that plays a sound. It sounds basic, but I feel like a lot of people don&#39;t actually understand fully how sounds and adding sounds in scripts work, so i just want to let more people know how to add these sounds to scripts, so they can do it in the future.<br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0vKS5sCnCmM" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
