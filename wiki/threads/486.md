<p>Thread By: Tjmoney030589<br />Hello all, I have a question that might be kinda noobish lol <br />On zombie risers is there a way to get rid of the exploding dirt effect and sound that plays? or is there a way just to have zombies appear? <br />One last thing is it possible to have them rise out of the ground without the crawling effect?<br />Thanks for any help :)</p>

<p>Reply By: Tjmoney030589<br />Sorry to be a bother, but I used zombie_location after script_noteworthy and my zombies are spawning in the middle of the map where there is no map yet lol Did I put this in the wrong spot?</p>

<p>Reply By: Tjmoney030589<br />Hey my friend, I have the structs in the start room of my map but they seem to keep falling from the round actor above the map. I do have custom zombies that I put in the map, but I don&#39;t think that would affect it. The only thing I haven&#39;t tried is changing the structs from the original. Thanks for all the help :)</p>
