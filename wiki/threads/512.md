<p>Thread By: MJPW<br />Im having an issue where if custom wall buys will crash the game on start. The Screen will be black while loading for a few seconds and then it&#39;ll just close. It will not show any errors. <br /> <br />I&#39;ve chatted with various modders but with all of the solutions they have suggested all have failed. All wall buy KVPs are correct I&#39;ve been trying to test with just one till we can get the ball rolling.<br /> <br />Any help is appreciated!</p>

<p>Reply By: MJPW<br />So I fixed it in a dumb way but hey...it works. I opened up a prefab of the default wallbuys and saved it as new ones. I put in the information for the guns it needed to give and moved the chalk texture/gun model far down. Originally my wallbuys were set up like this but I deleted out the chalk texture/gun model and removed the related KVP&#39;s (like you&#39;ll see in the picture I posted earlier).<br /> <br />I just wanted to share in case anyone else has this happen.</p>
