<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />Are you saying it doesn&#39;t teleport the zombies when it does this?</p>

<p>Reply By: Zombeast250<br /><blockquote><em>Abnormal202</em><br />Are you saying it doesn&#39;t teleport the zombies when it does this?</blockquote><br /> so the teleporter teleports the player and the sound plays perfect no errors but after the player teleports the zombies do not teleport to the script_struct with a targetname/zombie_destination    they take the long way back to the player<br /> <br /> <br />so if it helps i have 3 teleporters running off that script and all work the same for teleporting the player and not the zombies<br />thanks for the help</p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />Sorry If that ain&#39;t working I don&#39;t know what to do. I&#39;m not even sure you would want that to work though; cause if it&#39;s a shadows of evil style teleporter players could easily take advantage of it teleporting the zombies everytime they enter it. You could check out <a href="http://ugx-mods.com/forum/index.php/topic,14009.0.html">this tutorial,</a> only problem is it only works if the zombies have a theoretical path to the players.</p>

<p>Reply By: Zombeast250<br />so this style teleporter would work for me as the zombies teleport into a room beside the player teleport room so they would have to face them after they teleport and fight them to get out of the room they teleport to i am going to delete the other 2 teleporters an try again with 1<br /> <br />if you are unable to think of anything else that would make this work then thank you for all the help Abnormal202 on this subject and others</p>
