<p>Thread By: Tjmoney030589<br />I&#39;m not sure if this is the right place to put this (if not sorry <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://modme.co/emoticons/trollface.png"> ) I have two questions.... Question #1, I&#39;m trying to change the model of the mystery box, so I ripped MOTD MB but I&#39;m not sure exactly what to do after that. I have tried stamping the prefab, APE, and even tried the perk machine change but no luck I have only been doing this a couple months soooo I&#39;m probably just missing something easy lol... Now Question #2, I want the character in my new map to start without a weapon and when he gets out of the room there will be a gun on a dead body.... I know it has something to do with the script but my scripting sucks lol (we need more tutorials on scripting lol) any help would be awesome. Thanks :)</p>

<p>Reply By: Wild<br />IDK about the weapon part but this is how you change the mystery box model :) <a href="http://modme.co/index.php?view=topic&tid=957">http://modme.co/index.php?view=topic&amp;tid=957</a></p>

void &lt;player&gt; TakeWeapon(&lt;weapon&gt;,&lt;ignore_attachments&gt;)&lt;/ignore_attachments&gt;&lt;/weapon&gt;&lt;/player&gt;
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />and give it when they pick it up off the ground using the GiveWeapon function:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
void &lt;player&gt; GiveWeapon(&lt;weapon&gt;,[options],[acvi])&lt;/weapon&gt;&lt;/player&gt;
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />if you need more help, I could maybe make a script for you, but make sure you describe everything <strong>in detail</strong>.<br />&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;will there be more than one gun location?&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;will the gun model disappear off the floor when picked up? &lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Can players pickup the gun multiple times?&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ul&gt;</p>
