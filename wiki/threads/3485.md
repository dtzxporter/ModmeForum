<p>I have created a simple 3D square on Maya 2019 and then exported to a .xmodel_export file using the plugin &#39;COD tools&#39;, then used it to create a model on the Asset Manager, but I get this error:<br /><br />ERROR: Can&#39;t find material [phong1] in directory &#39;D:\Juegos\Call of Duty World at War\raw/material_properties/&#39; or &#39;D:\Juegos\Call of Duty World at War\raw/material_properties/&#39;<br />aborting....<br /><br />I have created a specific material which I named &#39;phong1&#39; in the specified directory, hoping the Asset Manager would recognise it, but the error kept showing up. Please, any suggestion to solve it?</p>
