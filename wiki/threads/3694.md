<p>I checked everywhere online but I just can&#39;t seem to find one.<br />Maybe experienced modders share some kind of an ancient codex that contains such list?<br /><br />On a more serious note, after checking in the docs provided by Treyarch and dozens of google searches, I couldn&#39;t find any resource that contains a list of all the events that trigger waittill() and endon(). Can anyone point me to the right place? Or could it be that such a resource doesn&#39;t exist and I should look for them in the official GSC scripts written by the devs?<br /><br />Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t a set list.<br />A notify will trip a waittill or endon<br />for example<br />level notify(&quot;test&quot;, param 1, param 2);<br /><br />will trip<br />level endon(&quot;test&quot;);<br />and<br />level waittill(&quot;test&quot;, param 1, param 2);<br /><br />You can replace level with an entity.<br /><br />If you want to see treyarchs notifies, you need to look in the gscs.</p>

<p>If you want to find a word / notify quickly, compress in &quot;.RAR&quot; the folder &quot;scripts&quot;.<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
Call of Duty Black Ops III\share\raw\scripts
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
Open the file &quot;.RAR&quot;, click &quot;search&quot; and write your word.</p>
