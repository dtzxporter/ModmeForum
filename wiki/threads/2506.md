<p>Thread By: TrumpetPro2002<br />I&#39;m having issues with animations for most games. COD IW and BO2 both have &quot;broken&quot; animations when exported. They play too quickly, and the speed changes as time goes on (or &quot;speed-stutters&quot;). Any help would be appreciated.

<p>Reply By: TrumpetPro2002<br />When I say &quot;broken&quot;, I&#39;m referring to the speed issue. The movements themselves are fine, it just speeds up and slows down randomly, and isn&#39;t entirely consistent (the body might be at just above normal speed at one point, while the face is going haywire).</p>

<p>Reply By: TrumpetPro2002<br />I forgot about this other issue. All first-person models have the same effect when you import an animation. Could be a scale issue. Probably unrelated, but all the models import sideways (just dragged on the .ma file and the .mel script).<br /> <br />Here&#39;s some screenshots:<br /><a href="https://gyazo.com/b9ad658301e8153434bf73acbd4187ee">https://gyazo.com/b9ad658301e8153434bf73acbd4187ee</a><br /><a href="https://gyazo.com/bcb8bdbf8d7492910d8cb898b5283f98">https://gyazo.com/bcb8bdbf8d7492910d8cb898b5283f98</a><br /><a href="https://gyazo.com/c5c0ba3fe703a8d097aa5ae2fb7036a9">https://gyazo.com/c5c0ba3fe703a8d097aa5ae2fb7036a9</a><br /> <br />EDIT: Here&#39;s the same scene with Sipe&#39;s body model (wasn&#39;t expecting it to work):<br /><a href="https://gyazo.com/175f5a1ff2359eb4d1d52df47595c743">https://gyazo.com/175f5a1ff2359eb4d1d52df47595c743 </a><br /> <br />EDIT 2: Turns out there&#39;s an updated SEAnim importer (using this one: <a href="https://github.com/dtzxporter/SETools">https://github.com/dtzxporter/SETools</a> )<br /> <br />EDIT 3: Didn&#39;t help. Anyway, the main issue now is the first person animation stretching. Happened with both the intro player (Wolf)&#39;s arms, and the basic viewarms_iw7 rig.<br /> <br />EDIT 4: Should&#39;ve been more clear. I&#39;m not trying to port animations from IW to BO3, I&#39;m trying to use IW animations in fan films, or recreations of scenes in other software. Not using a conversion rig because I need the original arms.</p>
