<p>Thread By: Pepergogo<br />So here&#39;s the thing:<br /> <br />I&#39;m trying to port custom characters in my map, but when I ported they look like this...<br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mESlppn" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /> <br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/27VyxMx" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /> <br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gQE1bXH" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /> <br />Now, the method I&#39;m using and I used in the past is just export a rig directly from the game (BO3) and bind the skin with the character.<br /> <br />In the past, my models look like broken because of the bind method I was using; but know I figured out how to look &quot;not broken&quot;, but this problem in the images still happening.<br /> <br />I know the method I&#39;m using it&#39;s not the appropriate, but is the best I can do by the time.<br /> <br />Btw, I download the models, so I didn&#39;t use wraith or greyhound to extract them, and they didn&#39;t came with a rig.<br /> <br />If anyone know how to fix them, make it better or anything that might help it would be really apreciated.<br /> <br />Thanks</p>
