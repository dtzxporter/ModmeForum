<p><blockquote>have you added some zombie character models to your map?<br /></blockquote><br /><br />thanks for getting back to me to offer help <br /><br />i didn&#39;t add anything to-do with zombies spawners or anything that&#39;s the first thing i checked lol how ever i fixed it in the end a quick google and its a common error ...<br /><br />i found this :<br /><br />How To Fix &quot;AIType zm_nuked_basic_01&quot; Error<br />The Error<br />This error causes the map youre testing to quit randomly (usually in a really short amount of time) and give this error on the menu:<br /><strong>&quot;AIType zm_nuked_basic_01 has no characters specified.

Find actor_zm_nuked_basic_01<br />4. Select it in the entity list<br />5. Hit &quot;Backspace&quot; to delete it<br />6. Save and recompile<br />7. Run the map and it should work<br /><br /><strong>Note:</strong> The reason you have to do this through the entity list is because for some reason it is not able to be seen or interacted with in camera view. I just did this in my map and it works perfectly again.<br /><br />now the entity that was added was a default model that i added when i started building the map to know heights and stuff but ya it turned it in to a nuked basic o1 some how i have no idea how as i didn&#39;t do it lol  but it was working the 1000ds times b4 it happened with that in the map so i don&#39;t know</p>
