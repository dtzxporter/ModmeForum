<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br /><p style="text-align:left;">I had this problem. It turned out because I had one sound that wasn&#39;t working, ALL of my custom sounds didn&#39;t work. You just have to find what sound is causing the problem. Check the launcher very carefully.</p></p>

I played around with the aliases and found a set of values in some way shape or form was causing the issue.</p></p>
