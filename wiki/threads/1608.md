<p>Thread By: CraftDAnimations<br /><p style="text-align:left;">I am currently working on importing all the pistols from Black ops 2 and so far *touch wood* its been good.  I am noticing that when you knife with the weapon in hand it has this weird frame that shows you holding an invsible gun.  Does anyone know how I implement the knifing action as these were not present with the xmodel and xanim export.</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">I am using the these taken from the one weapon available</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://image.prntscr.com/image/b2fd53b5e06044cfa4557db5f6af3d9c.png"></p></p>

<p>Reply By: Collie<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Just erase the lines you have for melee in the bulletweapon&#39;s file. Melee on bulletweapons is only for meleeing with the actual weapon itself, like for example a gun with a bayonet, or the multiplayer Kuda&#39;s gun smack. Make sure you leave the animations for meleeing blank and that &quot;Use as Melee&quot; is unticked under Melee fields and it will just use the stock BO3 zombies knife (Or any offhand melee weapon the player may have).</p></p>
