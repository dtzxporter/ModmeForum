<p>Hey so I&#39;m pretty new to modding, and when mapping, I had some window prefabs that I was using, I had 4 of them in the map and suddenly, one of them dissapeared and got replaced by a red box which I cannot select or do anything to, in 2D view it&#39;s called &quot;misc_prefab&quot;. Also, I tried to reload the previous save and when I loaded back in, this had happened to the remaining 3 that was in the map. I also tried to reimport the prefabs, but everytime they come in as this red box.<br /><br />Second issue is with lighting,it doesn&#39;t seem to show the lighting in the map, it doesn&#39;t cast shadows orhave any effect on the map at all, all I see is the &quot;orb&quot; which you adjust for the light, but it doesn&#39;t react with the map.<br /><br />If anybody could help me with these issues, that would be great!<br /><br /><br />-Robin</p>

<p>I actually just found this in the log regarding the prefab: 12:37:51: ERROR: Can&#39;t find xmodel &#39;_prefabs/zm/zm_newcustom/windows/window_square_breakable.map&#39; in gdtDB<br /><br />Now, the file is in the folder stated in the error, but I don&#39;t know what it refers to when it says &quot;in gdtDB&quot;</p>

<p>First the lighting. I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re talking about a light you placed in the map. If you don&#39;t see it it&#39;s either because it&#39;s too small (change radius) or the map is too bright and you need to increase the stops on the light. As for the shadows, you need to untick noshadowmaps<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.820.png' | relative_url }}"><br /><br /><br />As for the prefabs, you probably changed them to models by accident. I&#39;m basing this off your error.<br /><br />Select the boxes and remap them to a prefab<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.821.png' | relative_url }}"></p>

All though, I now have another weird problem, so I just reopened the map in radiant, and the windows are back, no idea why, but I will keep this in mind if it happens again!<br /><br />Second, the light, so I got the shadows, but I put the light inside a lamp, and now the lamp is insanely bright, it&#39;s literally white. I have no ideahow to fix this, I&#39;ve played around with the settings and the lamp stays white no matter it seems like.I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the map that is too bright outside the building or not?</p>

<p>For the record, I even put the stops down to 1 and it&#39;s still bright af</p>

<p>Oh boy oh boy oh boy, sometimes I hate myself. I figured out the problem... I had TWO lights at the same spot... please excuse my stupidity I&#39;m going to bed forever now, thank you</p>
