Example: A generator that starts once power is on.   3) How does one increase the emitting radius of a 3d sound? Example: A really big fire.   4) How does one make a brush, trigger or something emit sound?Example: A stream of water in a playable area that I want sound to come from.   Thanks, any help is highly appreciated.</blockquote><br /> 1) The official method to do this is currently broken, Treyarch &lt;strong&gt;are &lt;/strong&gt;investigating the issue however, we just need to wait.<br /> <br />In short, it makes use of ambient_package trigger_multiple brushes placed in areas and the ambients file to be used. I recommend looking at ZeRoY&#39;s Kyassuru sound release for clarification of this.<br /> <br />2) <a href="https://hastebin.com/yowafavudo.php">https://hastebin.com/yowafavudo.php</a><br /> <br />3) Find the alias of the sound you want to give a larger radius, and edit the DistMin, DistMaxDry and DistMaxWet parameters, increasing them.<br /> <br />4) <iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5yA8oFcunV8" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /> <br />EDIT: Changed PlaySound to PlayLoopSound in 2.</p>
