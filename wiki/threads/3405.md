<p>So Wraith Colossus not working with Youngblood, or at least I&#39;m not sure where to search for working version of it or method to make it work, or maybe specific version of the game requared.<br /><br />I was able to extract game archives vis quick BMS aswell as get the models files (if its indeed them) in md6mesh format. But past that I can do nothing with them. Considering what guy who made BMS script said, Youngblood uses sligtly modified compression and it doesn&#39;t need to skip first 12 bytes in order to extract files.<br /><br />Is there is anyway to maybe make Wraith colossus work or are there any different methods to convert md6mesh into usable format.</p>
