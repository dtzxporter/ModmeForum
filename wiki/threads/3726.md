<p>This is probably a ridiculously stupid question, but is there any way to get a model to play an animation that is in the game? For instance, I want to have the shadow man play an animation that he does during shadows of evil. Is this something I can do?</p>

<p>If it&#39;s in the game then yes. The same was as if you imported it from maya except you don&#39;t need to add it to the zone file<br />Check with greyhound if its there</p>
