<p>Thread By: Herocraftian<br />      First off I would like to state that I&#39;m new to mod development on BO3 and I am creating a World War 2 styled map and I wanted to create a mounted MG42 like the one featured in Gorod Krovi. Although when searching all I found was tutorials on how to do it on WAW. Then inside of the editor I found &quot;node_turret&quot; but no explanation on how it works. Is there a way to make a mounted MG42 or other? Thank you if you can help.</p>
