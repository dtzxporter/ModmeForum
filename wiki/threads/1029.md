<p>Thread By: FrankXu225<br />Hi guys! I saw some xmodels in APE has the type &quot;animated&quot;. And I found some tutorials about how to use scripting to make an model play animations. However, with the function:<br /> <br />&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;driver AnimScripted( &quot;germantruck_driver_closedoor&quot;, org , angles, driver.closedooranim )&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ol&gt; <br />I need to know the name of the animation (&quot;driver.closedooranim&quot; in above example). Do you guys know where to find those animation names/strings? I try to find them in APE but I failed. <br /> <br />Like the first fence-gate in &quot;Shadow of Evil&quot;. When you spend points it opens with an animation (if you don&#39;t know, this is the first gate in the game). I found this xmodel in APE, it&#39;s called &quot;p7_fxanim_zm_zod_gate_scissor_mod.xmodel&quot;. I cannot find any xanim related to this door, is there any doc I can look to find its animation name/string?<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://d7hqka.bn1304.livefilestore.com/y4mYAeMsaqaGRgcY0i799YDuKKFenAO7o0xBMEp3odYcCV6hkHr6kvKb6giIL2TJwl6R7e-71ftnfnTv8vBpALB63Z6maXULbFeUCFHBwYRTNjMevSWz-0aLYSWGi4ybyAg4Qpv-0oaeTyqVXVOH_Vez2Q_-G4A0VxgN7rHDqZ77uQlXeZ97Gt5dK1ZhbTXfNDLb-51vj61j2DZv9ZRYmg8wA?width=1387&amp;height=381&amp;cropmode=none"><br /> <br />Thanks for the help!</p>
