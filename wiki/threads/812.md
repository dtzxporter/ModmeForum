<p>Thread By: ProBeazt<br /><p style="text-align:left;">So I am currently working on 2 maps and I want all the sounds to be different in each map, round change etc. I have made a new user_aliases.csv but how do I link this to my 2nd map? Thanks</p></p>

I havent bothered looking into this myself but I know there are a few tuts or examples floating around, ie WARDOGS perks use a separate alias file </p></p>
