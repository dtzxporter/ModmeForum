<p>You&#39;d have to script it yourself, the flashlight script(at least the one I found online) just allows the player to turn on/off the flash light by double tapping the USE key. However it&#39;d be pretty easy to change it for what you are wanting.<br />How exactly are you wanting the flashlight to function?</p>

If you download the script from the megalink in the post by dreamzyy , it should work for you. <br />Like i said, I use it right now, and it works great. The only thing that is wonky with it is throwing nades breaks the flashlight, but after you get it installed, I can send you the fix I made for that issue.</p>

So you can open the sound alias they gave and copy the line into a sound alias you are already using in your map, or you can just include that sound alias as well. I recommend just copying the one line to another alias since it is the only thing in there.<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}

{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
That&#39;s the line you want to add to one of your aliases.<br /><br />If you want to add their alias, you can include it in the file located here<br />root\usermaps\yourmapname\sound\zoneconfig : open yourmapname.szc<br /><br />only do one or the other, you don&#39;t want duplicate sounds</p>

<p>Oh boy. So I guess there isn&#39;t a release for the flashlight, just small conversations that have links here and there. I&#39;m pretty sure Sleepy216 has the script that I modified when Mr. Lednor discovered the fx broke when the player throws a grenade. I&#39;m going to drop the latest flashlight I have in a release as soon as I finish up the last few tweaks and I&#39;ll put the linkie here.

I was just saying it wouldn&#39;t be difficult to change the existing flashlight script to function with triggers.<br />If Holofya&#39;s new script is just the Double tap USE key, I can probablly make it for you. However I don&#39;t want to do something if they already did it themselves haha</p>

<p><blockquote>So are you the original creator of the flashlight script? I would like to properly credit the maker of the script, I&#39;d feel like a dbag otherwise.<br />Thanks for taking your time to fix it up, can&#39;t wait for the release!<br /></blockquote><br />I&#39;m not the original creator but I fixed a bug it has. I have the full thing now and someone requested another feature so I&#39;m going to put it up with some instructions. I&#39;ll also package it up all nice and neat. (it has double press to turn on as well as auto activation by triggers)</p>

<p><blockquote>sorry to be annoying but any update on that flashlight.<br /></blockquote><br />Sorry, I work on the weekends so I don&#39;t have much time to do BO3 stuff. I&#39;m going to work on it today and hopefully get enough done to post it. Shouldn&#39;t be much left to do anyway &#129300;</p>

I ended up doing my own fix for the grenades when I found out they break the flashlight. I&#39;m glad you mentioned that you made it workable with triggers, Dakh will be hyped for that!<br />Do you happen to know the original creator of the script? I heard YAW mention &quot;their flashlight&quot;, and it too broke when throwing nades. However I feel Chaos would&#39;ve put his name in the readme if it was his script. I guess it isn&#39;t a huge deal about the credit, but it still makes me feel bad.</p>

I was told the one I had was sg4y&#39;s, but there&#39;s a tread that got transferred from the old Modme where it was shared, and there&#39;s also a thread where Spiki shared it. I couldn&#39;t tell you who made it but what I&#39;m going to post will be the best version of it &#128521;.<br /><br />Edit: and they&#39;re all the same base script</p>
