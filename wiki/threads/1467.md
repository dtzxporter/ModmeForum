<p>Thread By: MattFiler<br />Hey,<br /><br /><br /><br />I&#39;ve been trying to set up an emissive texture for my light model, but whatever I do it seems to always just look like a normal texture and doesn&#39;t glow.<br /><br /><br /><br />Could anyone give me some tips?<br /><br /><br /><br />Much appreciated!</p>
