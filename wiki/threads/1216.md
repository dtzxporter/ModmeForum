<p>Thread By: KillJoyYT<br />is it possible to have a trigger use or damage for killing a player? I know you can end the game by setting the &quot;script_flag_set_on_touching&quot;  to  &quot;end_game&quot;<br /> <br /> <br />any help would be muchly appreciated :-)<br /> <br />I am already aware of the trigger hurt.<br /> <br />what I&#39;m looking for is press x on the trigger and you&#39;re instantly downed</p>

// Threading it, put this inside main()
level down_player_func();

// Put this all the way at bottom, func itself
function down_player_func()
{
	// Finding the trigger in map
	damaging_trigger = getEnt("damaging_trigger", "targetname");
	// Text that you want to show on trigger
	damaging_trigger setHintstring("This trigger might kill you");

	// In case you want this to be retriggerable again
	while(1)
	{
		// Wait for player to hit it
		damaging_trigger waittill("trigger", player);
		// Kill the player
		player doDamage(666, player.origin);
		// Just in case since it is a loop
		wait 0.05;
		// Uncomment this, if you want it to be triggered only once
		// break;
	}

	// If trigger can be hit only once, delete it
	damaging_trigger delete();
}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />Just a simple thing, look at comments and modify to your liking</p>

// Threading it, put this inside main()

{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />^^ no<br /><br /><br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
// Threading it, put this inside main()
level thread down_player_func();
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />^^ yes<br /><br /><br />also the sensible thing to do would be<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
player doDamage( player.health + 666, player.origin );
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />and first check the player is even valid first<br /><br /><br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
if ( player laststand::player_is_in_laststand() || IS_TRUE( player.intermission ) )
	continue;
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
if ( !zm_utility::is_player_valid( player ) )
