<p>Hello Guys,<br /><br />I want some models in my map to rotate around one axis at a certain speed.<br /><br />I&#39;ve looked up some scripts for this, but unfortunally they give me a never ending black screen when i&#39;m loading into my map.<br /><br />I wonder if anyone has or could give me a simple script that works?<br /><br />I hope someone can help me out here! Thanks!!</p>

<p>Oke, so I managed to get it to work! I created another gsc file only for the rotation script and now it works!</p>
