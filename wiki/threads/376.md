<p>Reply By: easyskanka<br />oh mate thats a nightmare, the exact same thing happened to me last night after restarting my PC, Luckily i had a copy of my root folder on my desktop so i was able to just copy over the GDTS - i have no idea why this happened but it also messed around with my sound alias? i finally managed to get it resolved by reinstalling a few of the assets and replacing the lost materials. Does anyone know why steam does this?</p>
