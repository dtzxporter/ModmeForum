<p>Hi there,<br /><br />I wanted to know if it&#39;s possible that you update Colossus in order to be able to work with the game-files from Youngblood.<br />Thanks in advance!<br /><br />Greetings</p>

<p>Thanks for your response!<br /><br />Ok, that seems odd.<br />I&#39;m able to open the game files as usual but the export procedure fails as soon as I try to export any file.<br /><br />Steps to reproduce:<br />1. Download recent Wraith Colossus<br />2. Copy oo2core_6_win64.dll from the game directory *<br />3. Open chunk_2_pc.resources <br />4. Extract beds_luxury_bed_01 <br />5. Status &quot;Error&quot;<br /><br />* As there is no oo2core_5_win64.dll in the game-directory I copied the _6_ one and renamed it. But even without renaming the same error occurs.<br /><br /><br />Did I miss something?</p>
