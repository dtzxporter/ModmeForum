<p>hey,<br />So I&#39;ve decided to export every single hud icon and elements from black ops 4 and I found a lot of good images to use.<br />Then I see the hitmaker, and I wasn&#39;t sure if it was released here. I couldn&#39;t find a release so here they are.<br /><br />I also include some great-looking images to use as a headshot indicator or something.<br />they just looked cool.<br /><br />There is no function made or anything, these are just the images.<br />I did a little searching and there are a few tutorials/releases for hit markers, install those and replace the image.<br />maybe add more to it.<br />If you want to release a bo4 hitmarker script or anything with my release, please be my guest to do so,<br />I give you all the right to do whatever you want.<br />people could use a nice looking hitmarker :)<br />I did made a hitmarker function which can be used and installed very easily.<br />Click the following link to check that post,<br /><a href="https://forum.modme.co/threads/black-ops-4-hitmarker.3621/">CLICK ME!</a><br />

If you want to export the hitmarker by your self here is the name of the image:<br /><strong>&quot;ximage_746ed20c8d72617&quot;</strong><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1073.png' | relative_url }}"><br />You can use the original version however, I don&#39;t like the looks of it.<br />
<br />
These are the original Black Ops 4 Hitmarkers however,<br /><em>I did add some effects such as:</em><br /><strong>- Added more depth to colors so it pops more.<br />- Blurred the edges a little.<br />- added a nice soft shadow instead of the hard shadow from the original.<br />- added glow effect on the edge where the blur starts so it looks even better.<br />- added a little fade effect so the colors fade nicely.<br />- added a white version for a damage hitmarker (just like bo4)<br />- tested it out on multiple colored backgrounds, and it looks insanely amazing!</strong><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1058.png' | relative_url }}"><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1059.png' | relative_url }}"><br />
<br />
<em>These are not touched at all! you can see some hard shadows or non at all on some icons.<br />keep in mind that I only can post 10 images, so there is more in the actual download. (bigger and smaller)</em><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1064.png' | relative_url }}"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1068.png' | relative_url }}"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1063.png' | relative_url }}"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1069.png' | relative_url }}"><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1067.png' | relative_url }}"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1071.png' | relative_url }}"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1072.png' | relative_url }}"><br />
