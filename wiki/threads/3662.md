<p>Gun game script that can either start with the game or be started with a trigger use. You choose the guns and the order they are earned. <br />Shows what gun the player is on and how many kills to earn the next weapon.<br />All instructions for setup and use are in the script.<br />I&#39;m sure someone better at scripting has a better script. You&#39;re more than welcome to share your script rather than your criticism, but as I am preparing to delete my mod tools this script will not be getting improved any further by me.<br /><br />Download: <a href="https://mega.nz/file/QNAUmJiK#_L-tRQ8IhrooQueOx_O9LBcAd0HxeeYPqx0NuLO_irI">https://mega.nz/file/QNAUmJiK#_L-tRQ8IhrooQueOx_O9LBcAd0HxeeYPqx0NuLO_irI</a><br /><br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AWZLZPAyHk4" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
