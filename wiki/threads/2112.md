<p>Thread By: Ghostlycreep434<br />So in radiant when I try to open for example Exploder manager, it won’t open at all, no windows pop up.<br />Where there are sometimes where it’ll seem like something opened but doesn’t. I honestly don’t why it happens or how to fix it so some help would be greatly appreciated :)</p>
