<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br /><blockquote><em>m1cke</em>nvm got the timer thing to work Thanks alot nate</blockquote><br /><br />Ahh missed the player argument but I edited the original post so others wont get an error. I can never test things at work or university. I always seem to miss something small. Good to see you got it working!</p>
