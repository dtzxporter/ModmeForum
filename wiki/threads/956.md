<p>Thread By: itznvy<br />Hey is it possible that someone could help me out in making a script that gives you a random starting weapon each game? Like from a table? Like what natesmithzombies did on the random weapon powerup drop and you could actually edit its script and add weapons that could possibly drop. If someone does this, it would be greatly appreciated, and you would be credited in my map!</p>
