<p>Thread By: CalvinLarson<br /><p style="text-align:left;">could someone please make a script for shooting objects and when completed you get a perkaholic. Someone did make a script for this awhile back but it doesnt work because it doesnt give you mule kick and I tryed to fix it but I couldnt figure it out. It would be very helpful for someone to make a script for it. Thanks</p></p>
