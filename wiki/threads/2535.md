<p>Thread By: SpeedBeam<br /><p style="text-align:left;">I want to use The Giant BO3&#39;s round starts and ends. But I&#39;ve no clue how. Do I have to use DuaLVII&#39;s Round Sound Template or not?</p></p>

Look at the tab. The default ones for WaW is basically your usual ones. BO3 customs have The Giant sounds (some maps), but I want those sounds to my test map.</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p></p>

Do you own Black Ops 3 and have wraith?</p></p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Well I haven&#39;t been on WaW since forever, and I never changed the round sounds, but I did successful add in main menu music. I followed this <a href="http://www.zombiemodding.com/index.php?topic=7041.msg80023#msg80023">Tutorial</a> here to convert the song so it would work with WaW. This basically allows you to play the sound through scripting, but I&#39;m not sure exactly where the GSC that tells the round music to play is, or how to override it.</p></p>
