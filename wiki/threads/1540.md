<p>Thread By: ZombieKid164<br />I&#39;ve made a radiation material, which is a lit_emissive_scroll_3layer_advanced and is meant to represent the radiation splatters from the original nuketown zombies. Is there a way to turn this kind of material into a blend texture.<br /> <br />My material:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/lgwqx1z.gif"></p>
