<p>Hi,<br /><br />I&#39;m currently working on my second map, and I would like to have a custom power system.<br /><br />Basically, every perk machine would have its own power switch (Sort of like the system in mob of the dead, minus the afterlife)<br /><br />While having one power switch for every perk isn&#39;t the end goal, if I know how to script that I should be able to create the power system I need.<br /><br />Would this be feasible?<br /><br />Thanks!</p>
