<p>So I&#39;m currently making a &quot;night time&quot; map with lots of indoor areas which aren&#39;t effected by the skylight. As a result a lot of the map is very dark including both indoors, and outdoor areas under shade. Also the map is still quite dark even after adding lighting probes. So if anyone knows how to make my map just brighter in general that would be much appreciated.<br />Thanks.</p>

<p>You could try increasing the stops of the skybox ssi in APE</p>
