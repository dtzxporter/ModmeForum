<p>Fully functional AI of the popular AI type &quot;astronaut&quot; as seen in BO3&#39;s Moon.<br /><br />Also as seen in my map &quot;Portside&quot;: <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1171712833">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1171712833</a><br /><br /><span style="font-size:1.5em;"><strong>Screenshot:</strong></span><br /><a href="https://i.gyazo.com/d41c353764e708408fa6218107d1fd0d.jpg">https://i.gyazo.com/d41c353764e708408fa6218107d1fd0d.jpg</a><br /><br /><span style="font-size:1.5em;"><strong>Features:</strong></span><br />Spawns on round 1 (can be changed)<br />Health is based on zombie health + round. Health increases on an exponential curve.<br />Grabs Player<br />Takes random perk when teleported<br />Works with other AI perfectly<br />Quick implementation (Drag &amp; Drop)<br /><br /><span style="font-size:1.6em;"><strong>Notice:</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size:1.5em;">This AI was not designed to be easily changed. However, there are a few level variables near the top of the script that allow for easy changes. For example, if you would like for the astronaut NOT to spawn on round one, changing these variables would be ideal: </span><br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
level.min_astro_round_wait = 1;
level.max_astro_round_wait = 2;
level.astro_round_start = 1;
level.next_astro_round = 1;
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}

Everything should work as intended. I won&#39;t go over exactly how to set it up within radiant, as it&#39;s pretty self explanatory in regards to other zombie spawns.</p>

<p>How do you set the spawners up? I am a noob to map making! :D<br /><br />Would be great if you could maybe help out!<br /><br />Also, I have an issue: When I open the mystery box, it lags a lot. Do you know of any fixes?</p>

<p><blockquote>I don&#39;t have that bro error anymore but how do I set it to radiant?<br /></blockquote><br />Like i said you have to select the model placed somewhere in map then click and prefab then stamp prefab. After that select it again and give it a new kvp on the top type in target and under it add the targetname of your zone.<br /><br />I can make a detailed tutorial video if u want think thats better</p>

<p>Hi sorry, would there be a way to make the astronaut unsaleable and add some sound to it?</p>
