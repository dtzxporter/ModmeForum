<p>Hi all,<br /><br />When I try to “Run” my map from either BO3 zombies or the Mod Tools launcher, im met with this issue when the map is loading.<br /><br />[IMG alt=&quot;Annotation 2020-03-16 113215.png&quot;]https://forum.modme.co/attachments/annotation-2020-03-16-113215-png.493/[/IMG]<br /><br />[IMG alt=&quot;Annotation 2020-03-16 113246.png&quot;]https://forum.modme.co/attachments/annotation-2020-03-16-113246-png.494/[/IMG]<br /><br /><br /><br />To keep in mind, I did not add anything new to my scripts or edit them in any way.<br /><br />However, I did clear out and delete some of my storage from my computer. BUT, i made sure NOT to delete any files from August 2019 and on (since thats when I got BO3 and the mod tools together.) Does anyone think that I accidentally deleted any files for the mod tools while doing so, and thats what is causing this?<br /><br />Also, I do not get any script errors while &quot;compiling&quot; or &quot;linking&quot; my map. It does that just fine.<br /><br />If anyone has a solution please let me know, as i cannot test my map out: only build it.</p>

<p>Try Verifying the game &quot;BO3&quot; files in steam</p>
