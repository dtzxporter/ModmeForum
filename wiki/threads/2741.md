<p>I have a problem that some of my wallbuys says it cost 0 points, but when you buy it is the actual price. Here&#39;s an example:<br /><br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
iw6_l115,iw6_l115_up,,1200,sniper,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,FALSE,TRUE,sniper,,,
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br />Anyone know how to fix it?<br /><br />This is the code from another gun that actually work:<br /><br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
sniper_fastbolt,sniper_fastbolt_upgraded,,1500,sniper,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,FALSE,TRUE,sniper,,,
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
</p>
