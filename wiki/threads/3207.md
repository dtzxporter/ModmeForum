<p>Hi,<br /><br />Hello I post here to find hope after many attempts.<br /><br />First of all, here&#39;s what I&#39;ve done.<br />Verification of mod tool, basic files, no script was modified, test on several maps, redo the zones, remove all the scripts finally everything.<br /><br />Problem: From zone 2 the zombies <strong>don&#39;t see players 2,3,4</strong> anymore, we don&#39;t know why if<strong>player 1 dies</strong> then the zombies <strong>see players 2,3,4</strong> again and if <strong>player 1 reappears</strong> then it becomes <strong>only player 1 again</strong>. (<em>(if we go back to zone 1 he won&#39;t see players 2,3,4 anymore) </em>) if you want to see : <iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zn8oYX2WHxg" frameborder="0"></iframe><br />If we open zone 2 the zombies see us more ok, but if before opening zone 2 a zombie is on zone 1 and once we open zone 2 the zombie will detect the players, otherwise after he is dead the other zombies won&#39;t see the players anymore. <br />(This problem occured during an update on my first map I made, since then on every map I have this problem)<br /><br />We tested everything, and I also talked to one person for 2.5 hours and a half about this problem. I tested, to<strong>redo my zones</strong>, <strong>remove all the scripts</strong>, and also to <strong>put the basic spawner</strong>,<strong>I checked all the files</strong> to see if there was not an error and it does nothing. <strong>test in split screen and co-op</strong>. We traced the error since its origin, <strong>no beha file has been modified</strong> and <strong>also in the actor nothing at all</strong>, in <strong>APE no ERROR</strong>,  There are no script errors, no path errors in the logs, it&#39;s going well.<br /><br />Praaly<br />Thanks</p>
