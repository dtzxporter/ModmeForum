<p>I used<strong>[USER=615] eDeK[/USER] script of spawning zombies using a trigger_multiple and it works but when i <br />use it to spawn hell hounds they just spawn in and sit there and not attack the player.<br />so how do i get them to attack?</strong></p>

<p>Link to edek post?<br /><br />also are you spawning them at an isolated location like an island that is not connected to the main map? If yes drop a pathnode from the entity browser</p>

Idk what it is, i wont be home for a week to look it up. Something like special_dog_spawn or something. <br />someone else prob knows</p>
