<p>Madgaz is currently porting the models of all the BO3 Zombies maps, including Zombies Chronicles and therefore Shangri-La, here: <a href="https://forum.modme.co/threads/madgaz-model-packs-main-hub-map-dlc-model-packs.3055/">https://forum.modme.co/threads/madgaz-model-packs-main-hub-map-dlc-model-packs.3055/</a>  I would advise you to wait a few weeks for it though because he&#39;s currently working on Gorod Krovi at the moment but if you want to do them yourself, do them yourself. Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t madgaz only porting the static models meaning non moving?</p>
