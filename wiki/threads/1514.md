<p>Reply By: ElTitoPricus<br />Hi<br />you have to do another weaponfile in your gdt alongside the one you already have.<br />If you want a Grenade launcher it has to be projectileweapon if it&#39;s masterkey (shotgun) bulletweapon<br /> <br />You have to make it ALTWEAPON in Inventory <br /> <br />On the Alt Mode Options You have to call the weapon, for example let&#39;s say it&#39;s an M4<br />Your main weaponfile is a rifle, in his weaponfile you have to call the altweapon<br />A in the altweapon you have to call your main one <br /> <br />In the Xanims you have to call the xanim to change weapons in AltRaise line<br /> <br />In the ammo options put different ammo names depending on the weapon<br /> <br />And at the end in User Interface do not forget to make Ammo Counter Clip Style as AltWeapon<br />on the grenade launcher or shotgun or whatever is your altweapon  <br /> <br />To switch weapon ingame the default key is 4 <br /> <br /> <br />On the main weaponfile in Hide tags put the tag of your attachment that you want to use only in your altweapon<br />in the altweapon put whatever attachment you will use only in your man weapon /silenecers - grips - reflex...)</p>
