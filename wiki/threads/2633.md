<p>Whenever i go into game the zombie models are there but they do not animate. I ripped the default zombie model and used its skeleton in maya, then binded the skeleton to my custom model. I know it has something to do with the skeleton, there is just no tutorials on how to do this. ex: <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.49.jpg' | relative_url }}"></p>
