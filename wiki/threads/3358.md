<p>Hi, I am still a bit new to Mod Tools, but have been having lots of fun learning and working on my map :D. <br /><br />I&#39;d like to replace default zombie models with a custom model. So far, I have been able to export my model (from .obj) into an xmodel and imported into a custom GDT in APE. I have this model applied as the zombie spawner, but the model is very small, laying down horizontally, and stuck in a t pose.<br /><br />To address the first two issues, I&#39;m guessing I can just rescale and rotate my model in Maya. How can I rig my model? I tried quick rig, but I didn&#39;t change anything. I also read something about a zombie skeleton, but I&#39;m unsure exactly how to get one or what to do with it, if that&#39;s what I need. <br /><br />Thank you!</p>
