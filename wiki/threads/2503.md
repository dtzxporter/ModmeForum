<p>Thread By: Dis_6Cord_6xeX6NNN<br />I had a problem with exporting 3D maps models from the game DOOM. Namely with the textures, which are about 50 pieces on the Map. Models of characters and weapons are exported without problems, but when there is a textures of maps export, the program crashes on exporting 25 textures. I could then look for textures separately, but looking in a folder with all the textures is a hemorrhoids full.</p>
