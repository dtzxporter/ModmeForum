<p>Thread By: SwanK<br />Ever since I installed radiant I have had this issue with selecting curve patches or cylinders, and I have worked around it. But this time its really a problem and I need some help on figuring out why I cant do it.<br />I need to select a curve because for some reason in game it doesnt show the sides of the cylinder patch, only the top.</p>
