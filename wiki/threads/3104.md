<p>better models and sounds, in conjunction, create a grenade (throw-able explosive) that isn&#39;t shit (bad)</p>

<p><blockquote>better models and sounds, in conjunction, create a grenade (throw-able explosive) that isn&#39;t shit (bad)<br /></blockquote><br />I chose to use the T7 one, he chose to use the S2 one. &quot;Different&quot; models, so they&#39;re different ports.<br /><br />Doesn&#39;t mean to say mine is bad (which it isn&#39;t), no need for the toxicity at all</p>

<p><blockquote>Doesn&#39;t mean to say mine is bad (which it isn&#39;t), no need for the toxicity at all<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Yes - it is bad. You literally originally aimed to put such little effort into your &quot;release&quot; that you tried to get away with using concussion grenade animations that were already in the game, and then confidently stated ( despite being entirely wrong ) that ww2 didn&#39;t have stielhand grenades to validate your lack of willingness to put any effort ( a.k.a. laziness ). On top of that, your state timers are completely off ( you throw the grenade WAY to quickly ), you have no sounds ( ??? why not ??? ), and it appears to me that you don&#39;t have any ads animations, which makes the whole thing look even more entirely incorrect than it already is. So, in short, yes - this release is <em>OBJECTIVELY</em> better than yours.</p>

After your first comment (which was rude and uncalled for)<br /><br />I need to get locked up? Says the guy that scammed someone for $200 for apex legends models lmao<br /><br />Anyways, done here.

<p>Kingslayer it was a nice port, heck im still using it! and even if its not perfect at least you give mappers models/assets to work with. <br />This shit happend to Harrybo21, he&#39;ll put hours of work into mods only to get ripped on when he released them. When he removed all his assets, everyone went crazy looking for them...<br /><br />All i can see is ignore the a$holes (ThomasCat)</p>
