<p>Thread By: Blink-420<br />I have a spot on my map where zombies wont be able to get me, I&#39;ve been using weapon clips to &quot;balance&quot; it out, its part of an easter egg. If I could somehow get all the zombies, while im in that area, to run to an interest point out of my sight, that would be amazing. Any help would be appreciated!</p>

<p>Reply By: Exofile<br />If your map contains monkeys, Arnie&#39;s or anything at all of that sort, I highly recommend you DON&#39;T create this. Notice how Treyarch Studios did their &quot;Interest Points&quot;. It&#39;s a part of the EE, but you still want players to be aware of their surroundings.</p>
