<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />This is new to me (3 scripts giving the same error), but are you sure the sethintstring is correct?<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
&lt;entity&gt; SetHintString(&lt;hint string=""&gt;,[...])&lt;/hint&gt;&lt;/entity&gt;
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />Can you post the part of the script with the line that gives you shit?</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br /><blockquote><em>TrueGamerCalls</em><br />I know I just made a scripting post eariler but this is on a whole different level of what the fuck.   If you looked at my last post, I had a issue with scripting a pap system, with the help of many people I fixed it, and it worked. I added a part to the script that blocks the trigger to be activated until power is on, testing went great then I tried adding it to other switches.    Now my issue kicks in, it doesn&#39;t give me any errors in the launcher, but when I opened the game, it gave me a console error about &quot;SetHintString&quot; I was curious as fuck so I removed all mentions of what I just did, built, and linked, gave me the same error, wondered what the fuck is happening, built and compiled again, then now its giving me a error on the forest menu of zombies saying there is a issue with &quot;ugx buyable ending&quot; which is a script i&#39;m using with my map. I checked the line it gave me and it was something to do with &quot;SetHintString&quot; keep in mind I never got this error before, and I didn&#39;t mess with anything before. I deleted all mentions of said &quot;ugx buyable ending&quot; and now its giving me a error for harry&#39;s wunderfizz script, the line is once again dealing with &quot;SentHintString&quot;   Can someone tell me what the fuck happened? I don&#39;t know what is going on. If I have to reinstall mod tools for the 5th time let it be. I just feel like I&#39;m just a fucking idiot right now.</blockquote><br /> what error</p>
