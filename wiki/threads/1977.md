<p>Thread By: Fil he Modder<br />basically, i change/add weapons to the box, and everything is correct in the scripts too, for example, i remove attachments for guns like the rift e9, i compile the map and go in the game, it still has attachments, BUTT, when i go into the console and do /give pistol_energy, the gun version is updated like i wanted it to, same story with custom guns, can&#39;t get them in the box, but i can with console commands, what&#39;s wrong with this?</p>
