<p>Thread By: Gordo1920<br />Whenever I try to run my custom map on black ops 3, it says, &quot;Black Ops 3.exe has stopped working&quot;. I&#39;m not sure if there is something wrong with my GSC files or anything else that is connected to my map. If anyone has a suggestion to why this is happening it would be greatly appreciated. <strong>-Gordo</strong></p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />Would your map happen to contain alot of big sound files? (music)<br />Or maybe you have an infinite loop somewhere <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
while(1) 
{

}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}

When in Radiant, I had to manually run the map for bo3 and not check any of the boxes. Anyway thanks and this might be of good use in the future.</p>
