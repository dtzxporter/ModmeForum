<p>Thread By: XxCAFxX<br />Could someone please make a tutorial on how to get drivable vehicles on zombies? I&#39;m working on a BIIIG project. I&#39;m making the city of Delaware, OH (where i live) and having drivable vehicles would be an amazing addition to my map because of how big its going to be.</p>
