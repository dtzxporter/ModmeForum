<p>Thread By: Tjmoney030589<br />I was trying to change the mystery_box and to be honest I&#39;m still a NOOB <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://modme.co/emoticons/sad.png"> but I am learning lol (SLOWLY) <br />So the problem is I must have deleted something that was a no-no lol I have this on APE<br /> <br />The asset p7_zm_der_magic_box of type xmodel doesn&#39;t exist, so I&#39;m guessing I deleted it by accident.<br /> <br />If someone could please send me a link for one or tell me how to fix it that would be awesome. Thanks</p>
