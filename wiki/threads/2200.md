<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://ibin.co/w800/3ceuugFHj3Oj.png"><br />I had to work out the Modme image system too. basically you&#39;ll have to make sure the file extension (.jpg, .png, etc.) is at the end of the URL. you can get it by right clicking on the image and clicking on &quot;copy image adress&quot;. for this image it was:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
https://ibin.co/w800/3ceuugFHj3Oj.png
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}

I will work harder to create this unique master piece but in the mean time, i need to be working on a generic op map, especially one that has taken up the last 3 months of my life since. so I dont want to make you out to sound critical in anyway but i will take your advice in consideration and will come out with a unique map to your likeing :)</p>
