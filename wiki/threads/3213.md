<p>So I&#39;ve been trying for days to fix this problem and no solution that I&#39;ve searched for seems to work :(<br />I&#39;m getting and error &quot;error updating steam workshop item&quot; every time I attempt to publish my map. <br />I&#39;ve deleted the workshop.json file, no luck<br />I&#39;ve tried using different publish ID&#39;s, no luck<br />I&#39;ve even moved the entire map into a new .map file and still no luck.<br />I&#39;m completely lost at what to even try next... very frustrating putting months into a map and can&#39;t even publish it...<br />any help would be very very much appreciated &lt;3</p>

<p>I think just about everyone seems to be having issues with the steam workshop. Seen at least 10 ppl talk about it in different discord servers in the last few days.</p>

<p>Seems like if an upload size is too big (at least 2gb from what I&#39;ve noticed), it won&#39;t work. Meaning the only maps that can be uploaded at this time are blank troll maps, box maps and one window challenges... Joy...</p>

<p>again<br /><br /><br />no its if _one file after being compressed by steam exceeds 2gb_<br /><br />so your xpak - after the first progress bar when publishing, not the copy you see in your zone</p>

<p>Compile with lower light quality reduced mine pretty good. Was then able to upload. Can&#39;t say the same will help others though but worth mentioning I guess.</p>

Most of the extra &quot;size&quot; is coming from the map itself, weapons, static models, character/enemy models and custom textures.</p>
