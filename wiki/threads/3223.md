<p><strong>SOLVED</strong><br /><br />When i tried to reduce the quality of the model Maya threw a bunch of errors so i reduced the face count with MeshLab following this tutorial: <a href="https://support.shapeways.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022742294-Polygon-reduction-with-MeshLab">https://support.shapeways.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022742294-Polygon-reduction-with-MeshLab</a><br /><br />i limited faces to 64.000, worked fine</p>

However, most of the time using DTZxPorter&#39;s ExportX making it a xmodel_bin still works. But keep in mind, you&#39;re doing something that this particular engine wasn&#39;t designed to handle, so it can cause errors if it&#39;s way off.</p>
