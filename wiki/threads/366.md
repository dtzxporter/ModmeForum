<p>Thread By: Symbo<br />I don&#39;t know if it is common knowledge or something you should avoid but I just discoverd something regarding zones.<br />You can have zones inside another zone, they don&#39;t need to touch eachother. With the flags setup correctly, the zombies will spawn only when you enter the subaltern zone.<br />If corrects, I find it easier and more flexible than the usual way.</p>
