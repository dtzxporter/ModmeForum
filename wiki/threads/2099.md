<p>Thread By: Runis<br />Hey so I want to reinstall my mod tools because of a lot of problems I get that verifying game cache doesn&#39;t fix. But I don&#39;t want to remove my maps in the process. Anyone know a good method on doing that? I just want to keep the geometry, the custom scripts that were made I could care less about.</p>
