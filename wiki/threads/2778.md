<p>are you using harry&#39;s perks ?? if so copy the scrips back over again or just the _hb21_zm_utility.csc and _hb21_zm_utility.gsc as these files are newer in the perk pack by adding the sonic zombie you would have over written them with older versions</p>

<p>hey harry hows you doing m8 not trying to be a d~ck or anything bud but the instructions only say to add it to the gsc its not until you read further down in the troubleshooting section that it says about clientfield mismatch and to make sure its in gsc and csc<br /><br />also troubleshoot mentions perk machines all looking like speed cola and quick revive not lit up in solo<br /><br />if i remember correctly you did release sonic, napalm, updated-perk pack and updated gun pack all within days or even hours of each other maybe just a slight mistake regarding the sonic instructions<br /><br />anyway not trying to step on toes or like i said be a d#ck or anything still glad you shared all these great assets with us</p>
