<p>Thread By: Collie<br />Hi all, I am pleased to present the Improved Conversion Rig for MWR animations. There&#39;s not much for me to say here that I didn&#39;t already say in my post about the Improved Conversion Rig Reborn. The quality of this rig is identical to that of the reborn rig, and usage instructions are the same as well. <a href="http://aviacreations.com/modme/index.php?view=topic&tid=1375">Click here</a> to view the Improved Conversion Rig Reborn and the instructions for it.<br /> <br /><br /> <br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-UF20_AUjfTZ0tPUTQxNDJTeTQ">Download</a> <br />I&#39;d like to give a huge thank you to DTZxPorter for the support he has shown this rig. Without him, this rig wouldn&#39;t have been possible. <br /> <br />I&#39;d also like to give credit and thanks to Tom Crowley for his various tools, Azsry for giving me a baseline to create my own conversion rig way back when I had no idea what I was doing, Hitmanvere for getting me Lilith&#39;s viewhands, and Ardivee for also getting me Lilith&#39;s viewhands (but the lime version).<br /> <br />As always, if there are any errors in the post, the rig, or the shelf please feel free to let me know.</p>
