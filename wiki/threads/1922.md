<p>Thread By: Tuxos<br />I wanted to test out my Map and compiling and linking takes only about ten seconds. And I have about a hundread Errors which look as follows:<br /> <br /> ERROR: Duplicate &#39;image&#39; asset &#39;global_invisible_c&#39; found in c:\program files (x86)\steam\steamapps\common\call of duty black ops  iii\model_export\black_ops_3\xmodels\p7_zm_gen_proto_column_concrete_dmg_03\p7_zm_gen_proto_column_concrete_dmg_03_lod0.gdt:943<br /> <br />I have no Idea how to fix that, when I look at the location in my root nothing duplicated is there, nor in APE.<br />I also have two GDT errors I don&#39;t understand:<br /> <br /> GDT ParseError: File &#39;c:\program files (x86)\steam\steamapps\common\call of duty black ops iii\model_export\custom_models\vehicle_ger_tracked_halftrack\vehicle_ger_tracked_halftrack.gdt (@  line:47)&#39; Invalid asset name: &#39;i_halftrack_markings.001_c&#39; line: &#39;&quot;i_halftrack_markings.001_c&quot; ( &quot;image.gdf&quot; )&#39;<br /> GDT ParseError: File &#39;c:\program files (x86)\steam\steamapps\common\call of duty black ops iii\model_export\custom_models\vehicle_ger_tracked_halftrack\vehicle_ger_tracked_halftrack.gdt (@  line:2051)&#39; Invalid asset name: &#39;mtl_halftrack_markings.001&#39; line: &#39;&quot;mtl_halftrack_markings.001&quot; ( &quot;material.gdf&quot; )&#39;<br /> <br />If anyone knows what those are and how to fix them please let me know.<br /> <br />Thanks in advance!</p>
