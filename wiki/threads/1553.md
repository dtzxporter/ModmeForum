<p>Thread By: mathfag<br />I&#39;m having a minor problem with a weapon port that I&#39;ve been stuck on for 3 days. The weapon shoots a projectile but said projectile needs to fall to the ground after about 1000 inches. The problem is that I need the speed to be high (3500 in/s) but that means the projectile will stay in the air. So my question is what&#39;s the setting for controlling the vertical speed (or mass if that&#39;s a thing) of a projectile?<br /> <br />Projectileweapon<br />Inventory: primary<br />Type: projectile<br />Cless: grenade <br /> <br />I also gave the projectile model a physpreset but that doesn&#39;t do anything.<br /> <br /> <br />Bonus question: Is it possible to do a charged shot which makes the projectile fly further before landing?</p>
