<p>Hey all,<br /><br />Im using Spikis brutus and I was wondering if there was a script that was available, that when the player walks into it, 2 Brutus spawn.<br /><br />Also, would I be using a trigger_multiple to set it up?<br /><br />Thanks! :)</p>

<p>There is a thread that already mentions this, although, I have not used Brutus before, but it looks like this could be your answer. <a href="https://forum.modme.co/threads/brutus-spawn-trigger.2913/#post-13984">Brutus Spawn Trigger</a></p>

Do I have to specify the trigger in the script?</p>
