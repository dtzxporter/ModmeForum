<p>Thread By: ZombieKid164<br />I am currently making a map, which I plan to call Stadt der Untoten (German for &quot;Town of the Undead&quot;) It is based around a small town with some houses and a larger factory like building. I have been working on it for a couple weeks, so here are some screenshots:<br /><br />(Sorry for the links, but whenever I try to upload/embed the image, it says &quot;image cannot be viewed&quot;. If someone could fix this for me, that would be nice...)<br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1qmu2LCpBEldWFLOWV1N2Zlb0E">1</a><br /><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1qmu2LCpBElUGVIVkpDZmc3bGM">2</a><br /><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1qmu2LCpBElRENmbm1NTXVYM1E">3</a><br /><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1qmu2LCpBElSHF0dmJVTnZqLVU">4</a><br /><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1qmu2LCpBElQW5HRno4SlY3cjQ">5</a><br /><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1qmu2LCpBElZFQyOG5XNzRUUFk">6</a><br /><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1qmu2LCpBElaUlhQVNwVTVqNmc">7</a><br /><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1qmu2LCpBElUHBoeEN3cW1hVkE">8</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I need some feedback. Does it look good?, Should I add more/what should I add?, etc.<br /><br /><br /><br />Here&#39;s another pic of an area which I do not know what to add yet. I need some suggestions for it:<br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1qmu2LCpBElTTJpVFBJdkFfNXc">9</a><br /><br /><br /><br />That&#39;s it for now. I will be updating more soon.</p>

<p>Reply By: Spirit I eagle<br />its hard to see on the pictures. What you can do is make the light better. That makes the map much beter</p>

I&#39;m working on relighting alot of the rooms as when I first made it I screwed up the lightting. Some rooms are meant to be a little dark though for atmoshphere<br /><br />Do you have any other suggestions?</p>
