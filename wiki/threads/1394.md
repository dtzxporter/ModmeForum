<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />For spawning models you can use:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
model = util::spawn_model( "model_alias", location );
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />As for the location, that&#39;s the tricky part. You&#39;ll have to find a way to get the location of where you want to place the model in the map somehow. I did this by using a mod that I scripted that gives you a ton of money, and the ability to print your current location/angles in the map. You can use <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1242946241">the mod I made</a> if you want, or just make your own, it&#39;s not too hard.</p>

When it comes to making a mod for zombies maps, you&#39;ll need a &quot;hook&quot; of some kind so you can &quot;inject&quot; your edits, usually people use the double points scripts, _load, etc.</p>

#using scripts\shared\util_shared;<br />/* |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||<br />Models<br />|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| */<br /><br />function main()<br />{    <br />    util::spawn_model( &quot;black_hole&quot;, (1,1,1), (1,1,1));<br />}
