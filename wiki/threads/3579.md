<p>Basically I&#39;m working on a modern uk house scene in radiant and models from MW19 would be really handy, specifically models from the clean house as that contains a lot of models that would be really useful to me. Would anyone be able to get me the models from the mission? All I need is the .XMODEL_EXPORT or .XMODEL_BIN. Thanks in advance :D</p>
