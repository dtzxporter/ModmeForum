<p>Thread By: soul-toktzt<br />Hey everyone,<br /><br />Anyone knows how i would go about if i want to seperate the players?<br /> <br />I am making a slide-obstacle course (sort off) and i would like them all to be in a seperate lane (and make sure there&#39;ll never be 2 or more on 1 lane).<br /> <br />Everything is fine, like having 4 squares where they can stand on, or maybe edit the teleport_player+origin script so they&#39;ll spawn all at a different origin.....</p>
