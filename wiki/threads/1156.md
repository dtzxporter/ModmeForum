<p>Reply By: Exofile<br /><blockquote><em>D-2-K</em><br /> couldnt you just make a map without adding the gobble gum machines though ??    </blockquote><br /> <br />That&#39;s different. If you want a map with gobblegums, but you don&#39;t want people to use Perkaholic this is what you <strong>could</strong> use, though it&#39;s a very crude solution.</p>

Perkaholic is way too OP and it can ruin zombies maps, its great to be able to block the use of these gobblegums</p>

<p>Reply By: Zixology<br />The only thing I&#39;d rather have than this is an anticheat that makes people unable to use other mods with my maps. Sadly, people can just use the instant perkaholic mod and bypass this, even if your map doesn&#39;t even have the gobblegum machines. If only people could just play fair and give a mappers map a chance before breaking it.</p>

<p>Reply By: FreeAccount<br />I&#39;m new and confused here. Why do you care if they use certain gobblegums? I&#39;ve played with a mega to see what it does and landed in an absolutely unplayable map because of it. All my points and guns taken away every minute except for starting pistol. And it kept flashing &quot;learn to play&quot; at me. I still somehow survived a while but I&#39;m really just confused about why people get so bent out of shape if a random person playing for fun or for a review or for whatever reason wants to use something you didn&#39;t intend. I wouldn&#39;t want to force people to play a certain way and just piss people off who want to play a slightly different way. BO3 is not getting the attention WAW has gotten despite all of its potential and this kind of elitist attitude isn&#39;t helping. I appreciate sharing of knowledge and code, but seriously you might have some issues if you&#39;re calling people fags for equipping a gobblegum you didn&#39;t put on your approved safe-to-play list.</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />If we want to actually design maps “properly” then that includes balancing gameplay - get over it</p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />Like Harry said; why the hell would we bust our asses for months to make something if you&#39;re just gonna walk through the whole thing with &quot;shopping free&quot;. This is especially true for challenge maps where bgb machines are in use and speed running is a thing. You&#39;re entitled to your opinion but I&#39;m just saying.</p>

<p>Reply By: Ping998<br />if yous don&#39;t want to be as harsh and kick the player, you can do this:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
while (1)
					{			
						IPrintLn("CHEATS ARE BEING USED! PLEASE DISABLE THEM!");
						wait(30);
					}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />Replace the internals of the if statement &quot;if (gum&gt;0)&quot; with it.<br /> <br />Instead this script will allow the player to play normally but every 30 seconds a message calling them out on their cheats. Expose those pesky cheating youtubers XD.</p>
