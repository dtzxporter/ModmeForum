<p>How could I make a trigger_damage that could be activated multiple times per game and every time you have to use a different weapon. For example, if I wanted a trigger that every time it was shot it would give you a max ammo, and I shoot it with the ray gun, next time I want to do it, the ray gun wouldnâ€™t activate it. Hopefully that made some sort of sense. I hope this idea is possible and/ or practical.</p>

This is some stuff i had that worked thrown together, self is the trig that is threaded from a previous function, if you are using only one trig u can just change self to a trig name... and make sure you set up a struct for the powerup and of course change the weapon... if u want it to be any weapon just doing waitill trigger on a trig damage will work</p>

Also I appreciate the help</p>

<p>Hm not sure about that, im sure it can be done by using a variable for the gun thats used and making it so the trig doesnt accept that variable anymore</p>

<br /><br />If you wanted to shoot it with specific guns in order then write back and we&#39;ll work something out<br /></blockquote><br /><br /><br />I appreciate it, but I am able to activate the trigger with the same gun an infinite amount of times. Just to make sure, all I needed to do was create a trigger_damage with &quot;whatever trigger&quot;, &quot;targetname&quot;?</p>

</blockquote><br /><br />If for example I wanted to make it delete a script_brushmodel everytime I activate the trigger, but not all of them at once. How would I do that?</p>

<p>Basically give your bruhsmodels the KVP &quot;index&quot; and value any integer. start at 0. So the first brush to go has the value 0, second has 1, 3rd has 2... If you want to shoot twice to remove 1 brush, just skip a number so first is 0, second is 2, third is 3...<br /><br /><br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
