<p>Thread By: mathfag<br />I&#39;ve been trying to add multiple electric traps to my map and I changed the KVP&#39;s to &quot;trap_b&quot; like the traps on the giant but I get not available. I have scanned the scripts and I didn&#39;t find anything.<br />If anyone had this problem, please post the solution.</p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />Scratch that. Looks like I just forgot to link the trigger with the structs. (target trap_b)</p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />New problem:<br />How to make 1 switch activate 2 sets of zappers like on Verruct. Copying the prefab and removing the middle struct doesn&#39;t seem to work.</p>
