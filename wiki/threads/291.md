<p>Thread By: Abnormal202<br />In many of the official black ops 3 maps, there are places where zombies spawn outside of the playable area, and then run into the map through a window without any barriers. I would like to have zombies spawn outside of the playable area, and then hop a fence to get into the playable area. In WaW this was done with simple pathnodes and traverses, but I don&#39;t know how to do it in black ops 3 as the path nodes and traverses seem to work differently.</p>

<p>Reply By: Blink-420<br />You could try creating a script_struct with the same script_string KVP the window barriers have and put a traverse on the fence. Not sure though..</p>
