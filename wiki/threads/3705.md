<p>Hi, I tried importing Skye&#39;s WWII weapons. I added the Winchester wallbuy, and my game crashes when trying to load the map. I was wondering if my .zone file is set up correctly, because I read in another thread that crashes can happen when a wallbuy is present that hasnt been added to the .zone file. The list continues as it does in the original file provided.</p>

<p>update: the problem was that I didnt realize that it had not finished building cause I didnt expect it to take long. I am impatient.</p>
