<p>Thread By: Jacobsmob<br />For the last few days I&#39;ve been trying to make my own perk. I&#39;ve searched for quite some time to find how to make a perk bottle weapon but cant find any reliable source so I&#39;m hopping this community is able to help.  <br /><br /><br /><br />I mostly need to know what asset to select and how to set up the drinking animation properly, Thank you.<br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT: Oh, this is for black ops 3 btw.</p>

I&#39;ve get this part down, but I don&#39;t now how to make the weapon part of it. Making the bottle animation(when you drink) requires a weapon with the drink animation(I think) I just don&#39;t know where to put that and what weapon asset is appropriate. <br /><br /><br /><br />I&#39;ve actually moved on and am just going to make the code from scratch without using all the perk certifications and things the game gives you. Without a ref for making perks using the things they give you, its too hard for me to tell what I need to do. Thank you for trying to help :D</p>

<p>Reply By: xSanchez78<br />It&#39;s simply making a weapon file that has the view model set to the perk bottle and the raise animation&#39;s set to the drink animation. You make this in APE and include it using weapon,zombie_perk_bottle_&lt;whatever you=&quot;&quot; named=&quot;&quot; it=&quot;&quot;&gt; and use that name in your perk&#39;s script.&lt;/whatever&gt;</p>

<p>Reply By: ItalianMilkMan<br /><p style="text-align:left;">I need some help with this aswell. Ive ported the drinking, idle and lower animations for the BO1 perk bottle, and i&#39;ve ported the perk bottle world and view model. I have everything ready, I just need to put everything into a weapon file. I know that the weapon file needs to be a grenade weapon, but I do not know where to put my animations under (Do I put them as first raise? Raise? Empty Raise?) and what settings to change and are there any box&#39;s that I need to tick in the weapon file.</p></p>
