<p>Thread By: Dextro62<br />I have an area in my map that hurts the player if they enter it. I would like it to play a looping sound when the player enters the trigger_hurt that then stops when the player leaves the trigger hurt. I&#39;d also like to have it so that only the player in the trigger_hurt hears the sound.<br />I attempted to script this myself but the sound didn&#39;t loop and it only played the first time I touched the trigger.<br />Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />I haven&#39;t tested it, but see if you can get this to work:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
function hurt_trig_sound()
{
	trig = GetEnt("HURT TRIG TARGETNAME","targetname");
	players = GetPlayers();
	while(1)
	{
		foreach( player in players)
		{
			if( player IsTouching(trig))
			{
				player playloopsound ("YOUR ALIAS NAME HERE");
				player.was_in_hurt_trig = true;
			}
			else if(player.was_in_hurt_trig == true)
			{
				player stoploopsound();
				player.was_in_hurt_trig = false;
			}
		}
		wait(0.05);
	}
}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
I&#39;m not sure how the looping sound functions work, I haven&#39;t used them yet, but see if this works.</p>

<p>Reply By: Dextro62<br />I tried this but the sound didn&#39;t play. I added couple of lines of code to display text messages to see what lines of code was running.<br />It looked like this.<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
function hurt_trig_sound()
{
	trig = GetEnt("hurt","targetname");
	players = GetPlayers();
	while(1)
	{
		foreach( player in players)
		IPrintLnBold ("after foreach player");
		{
			if( player IsTouching(trig))
			{
				player playloopsound ("d_switch_on2");
				player.was_in_hurt_trig = true;
				IPrintLnBold ("after hurt trig is true");
			}
			else if(player.was_in_hurt_trig == true)
			{
				player stoploopsound();
				player.was_in_hurt_trig = false;
				IPrintLnBold ("after hurt trig false");
			}
		}
		wait(0.05);
	}
}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />As soon as the game started the text &quot;after trig hurt is true&quot; kept repeating and didn&#39;t stop.</p>
