<p>I got no clue <br />But dude, not to be a dick or anything, just wanna make it easier for you. You have posted a LOT the last couple weeks and most of either doesn’t warrant you making an individual thread for it, or can be found via a simple google search/YouTube. Countless guys out there to help you with some of the things you’re encountering.<br /><br />BUT if you do feel the need to reach out, best bet is to go through discord and join some of the chats. The modding community is more or less dead but there’s a few people who actively help and regularly post for us.</p>

<p><blockquote>It is<br /></blockquote><br />No I mean like for example we already have widows wine we don’t have to script it in, therefore we already have all models, texture etc... in the mod tools we don’t maya or anything like that. That’s what i mean by I wish Black Ops 3 Mod tools was a lot easier. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>No, as maya is external - and even 3arc use it<br /><br />installing the plugins - is not hard at all and they certainly are not out of date<br /><br />just follow the instructions</p>
