<p>Thread By: LBGamingYT<br /><p style="text-align:left;">I want to do something like Rave in the Redwoods where you start out with Fists instead of the MR6 and have melee weapons scattered around in the spawn area, how would I go about doing this? Also, would I be able to modify the damage values of said weapons so they aren&#39;t too overpowered as they usually are?</p></p>

<p>Reply By: Lokii<br /><p style="text-align:left;">You could just get the Starter Weapon script and then change it to mp_fists or if that doesnt work try the different values that associate with the Fists, you may also want to port them over to zombies using APE which isnt hard all you need to do is find the weapon and its properties and then copy them and change them to zombies and have them target the zombie mods instead of the multiplayer mods, it should all go into place but thats the gest advice as i havent really gotten time to try that with my map yet</p></p>
