<p>Thread By: XxCAFxX<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Okay, so if i were to export a weapon from bo3 along with its anims, sounds, etc. would i still need to use maya or could i just slap it into ape and go from there? sorry, im a noob when it comes to weapon porting, ive never done one before and i figured if i could do it using a bo3 weapon if i dont have to learn maya it would be alot easier to learn. </p></p>

<p>Reply By: Exofile<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Wraith exports SEanims and .ma files for you. From there you will need to bind the gun in Maya, export the gun in Maya- add the animations to your gun in maya and export them. THEN you&#39;ll want to use Kronos to convert the exported animations and models into the right format, not to mention your images. :- ) There are a couple of tutorials online you can look at.</p></p>
