<p>Thread By: greatbrendini<br /><p style="text-align:left;">my m1911 dualwields reload normally except for when my left m1911 has no ammo and the game triggers the reload, then it will reload like normal, and reload right after for no reason, it also does 2 fire anims when only shooting once and needs to be reloaded when i first pullout the weapon. i have redone the anims in maya like 4 times with seanims to no avail</p></p>
