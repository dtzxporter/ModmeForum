Through the prefab as well?</p>

( or press F9... )<br /> <br />stamping the prefab messes up the target / targetname kvps. Youll have to put them back manually if you stamp</p>

<p>Reply By: TCM<br />I entered the prefab and set a hint string but it doesn&#39;t use the custom one I set. I am trying to set one so they know the traps name that&#39;s being activated</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br /><blockquote><em>MyNameIsNobody</em><br />is there a way to keep the traps from harming bosses (Brutus, Napalm, Shreaker)?</blockquote><br /> we added optional overrides in each trap<br /> <br />eg :<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/4172d12f5efd15e949c734748f8746e9.png"><br /> <br />check the scripts for the variables, set them as true on your ai and ill be ignored by the trap code</p>
