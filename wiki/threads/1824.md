<p>Thread By: Abnormal202<br /><p style="text-align:left;">This may be a dumb question, but in Black Ops 3 is there a way I could share a Beta version of my map with someone else without releasing it on the Steam workshop? Or Perhaps there is a way to put it on the Steam workshop, but make it private so only they can access it? In WaW there was no formal release so it was easy to share. I just want to know what the possibilities are if anyone knows.</p></p>
