<p>Thread By: Zixology<br />I had this issue with one of my maps a few days ago when trying to update some textures and just decided to leave the textures alone and focus more on my new project.<br />All I did was recompile my current WIP map because I wasn&#39;t sure how long it had been since the last test. Now, every change I make to the map doesn&#39;t matter because of that same WARNING I got with the first one.<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
WARNING: NavVolume generation is skipped. Flying units might not behave correctly. This might be due to there is no nav_volume brush in the level, or the generation is skipped purposely by skipping -navvolume option.
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />I have no idea how to fix this and it doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s been fixed anywhere else either. I&#39;ve added literally nothing new and this just sprung up out of nowhere. If this keeps up, I won&#39;t be able to make maps anymore.</p>
