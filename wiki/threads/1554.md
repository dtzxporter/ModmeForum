<p>Thread By: NoScopeNinja25<br />I was porting the Executioner from BO2 and everything was going well until I set the class in APE to pistol spread.  Once I do that in-game the ammo shows up as double what it actually is.  Reloading adds two bullets each time instead of one and shooting uses up two from the clip.  Also, the clip size is ten instead of five and the ammo stock is doubled too.  When I set it back to the regular pistol class the ammo shows up properly but then the bullets don&#39;t spread.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br /> <br />Reload add is set to 1.<br /> <br />Here is a gif of the problem:<br /><a href="https://imgur.com/qebFrGj">&lt;img title=&quot;source: imgur.com&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qebFrGj.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qebFrGj.gif&quot;&gt;</a></p>

Here is a gif of the problem:</blockquote><br /> use spread, not pistol spread<br /> <br />pistol spread was literally made for the dual marshals and nothing else<br /> <br />theres no difference other than the fucked up display</p>

<p>Reply By: NoScopeNinja25<br />That fixes the ammo display but now the third person animations look like the player is holding a shotgun.</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />you can change the animations set in the weapon file if its on &quot;default&quot; itll use the weapon class as a &quot;fall back&quot;<br /> <br />change the animations to pistol</p>

<p>Reply By: NoScopeNinja25<br />I don&#39;t see a pistol animation type.  The closest one I can find is onehanded and it still has a few problems.  Is that the only one for pistols?</p>

<p>Reply By: NoScopeNinja25<br />I&#39;ll just use the onehanded animation for now.  Thanks for the help.</p>
