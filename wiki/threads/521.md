<p>Thread By: Runis<br />Is there a way to select a ton of brushes/whatever at the same time? I have a few map sections I want to put in prefabs but there is a bunch of cuts in brushes and I don&#39;t want to spend 20 mins selecting all of them and hope I don&#39;t press a button that deselects everything. Could I make a big brush and have everything inside it get selected?</p>

With the brush still selected go to Selection -&gt; Select -&gt; Select Inside.<br /> <br />You can also just right click and then go Select -&gt; Select Inside.</p>
