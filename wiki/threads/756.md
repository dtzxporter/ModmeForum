<p>Thread By: MJPW<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Hi there! Im putting the axe into my map and I was curious if there was some sort of way to make it similar to the one in Zombies In Spaceland. Even if it does a select amount of damage to the area that you are swinging in that would be pretty cool. That way the melee weapons would be worth holding on to for a while.</p></p>

<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br /><p style="text-align:left;">I believe there is a notify on the player after a melee is complete called &quot;Melee_end&quot;. I could very easily call that on the players and then have a check for the weapon and the player angles to be sure they are facing the zombies, then I can kill them. It shouldnt be hard assuming that the melee weapon is similar in asset properties to a normal weapon. I don&#39;t know much about weapons (only because I knew everyone else would just do them so I never bothered lol). </p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">Can you give the weapon in console like a normal weapon? Example: /give zm_wpn_axe</p></p>
