<p>Thread By: Logical_Edits<br /><strong>Hello,</strong> I need help from someone to help me script an Easteregg into my map. I&#39;ll give you details when we start working on it. My maps theme is Stranger Things (Netflix TV Show) and its based off on office/laboratory in the mountains. I&#39;d appreciate any help, so thank you in advance.</p>
