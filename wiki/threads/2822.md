<p>Is it possible to import a single player ai npc character into a zombie map?<br />just a shot in the dark but i wanted to have soldier you have to escort to a objective.<br />then have the soldier have a gun shoot at the zombies along the way. maybe?<br /><br />I&#39;m thinking you have to rig them because whenever you select a npc<br />and place them in a map they are in the T pose, not to mention the scripting as well.<br />also is there a way to open the bo3 fast files? i wanted to take a look at the cp campaign <br />GSC scripts thank you.</p>
