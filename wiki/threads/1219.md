<p>Reply By: tbone-5<br />An easy way to do this is to just name the viewmodel or world model to what your replacing. So Just name the custom model the name of the model your replacing in ape, than go into your zone &amp; do xmodel,nameofModel than it should replace the model with that name with yours in ape</p>
