<p>Reply By: Exofile<br />You can go ahead and read up on the function in the ScriptDocs.<br />For simplicity; here is the function:<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
void SetLightingState(&lt;new light="" state=""&gt;)&lt;/new&gt;
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />Just choose the number you&#39;d like. The game starts off at Lightingstate 1 on start, for reference.</p>

In Radiant; Lightingstate 1 is equal to 0 in scripting. 1-4 in Radiant, &amp; 0-3 in Scripting. When I say it starts on 1 I was referring to the Radiant- version of the lighting state, if you understand.</p>
