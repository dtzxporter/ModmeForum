<p>Thread By: Henkownd<br />Hey,<br /> <br />Recently I was porting some Black Ops 3 weapons like the Olympia and the AN-94, however after porting some animations successfully I started getting having this issue where the gun is has weird angleing in maya making those animations unusable. In order to attempt to fix this issue I have already reinstalled Wraith, the Cod Maya 2.0 tools and the SEanim tools unfortunately none of these have fixed the issue, and the weird thing is it happens on some animations but not on others. <br /> <br />This is the idle animation which works flawlessly:<br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a/9YDrD" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /> <br />This is the reload animation on the first keyframe:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://imgur.com/a/Pbb1q"><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a/Pbb1q" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /> <br />Hopefully you are able to help me, and have a nice day.<br /> <br />-Henkownd</p>

Then, make sure that on tag_weapon_right, Joint Orients are zeroed.</p>

<p>Reply By: DTZxPorter<br />Harry is right, the only time you reset it is when making the anim model. Follow <a href="http://phabricator.aviacreations.com/w/models_and_animation/importing_an_animation_for_call_of_duty/">http://phabricator.aviacreations.com/w/models_and_animation/importing_an_animation_for_call_of_duty/</a> and you&#39;ll be all set. It&#39;s the only full-on tutorial which goes over properly importing a SEAnim. In addition, when porting with a normal rig, you can just use SETools-&gt;Game Specific-&gt;CoD-&gt;Attach Weapon To Rig, and it will properly setup the gun.<br /> <br />Your old method *may* work for some, but is flawed and will fail on some animations. Marking solved as this is the correct way to do it.</p>
