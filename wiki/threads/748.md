You can also add a buyable/free last perk removal trigger. </p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">If you are to make a tutorial with my content you must link the original ModMe post.

<p>Reply By: MinePro14<br /><p style="text-align:left;">the price of buy a slot of a perk is the same, is that possible to do that when you buy a slot it costs 1000, the second buy will cost 1250, then 1500, then 1750,then 2000, something like this, or 10% more than the last, is this possible?</p></p>

I am busy ATM and even noticed I didnt even add the request from the previous comment lol. I can add this to the list of things I want to change/add to my scripts. I am focused on a few other releases first though before I start editing existing releases </p></p>

<p>Reply By: Azazel<br />thank you for this! I was wondering if you could possibly make it so the remove perk option was perk specific? say, adding a trigger to individual perks that checks if the player has the perk already, and if they do, they have the option to remove it? <br /> <br />idk if i was clear enough lol it sounds confusing<br />basically <br /> <br />- player buys perk (example, juggernog)<br />- player doesnt want that perk anymore, or wants to open a slot  <br />- player goes up to perk machine (juggernog), and a message is on screen that says &quot;Hold square to remove perk&quot; <br />- player loses jug, but keeps other perks<br /> <br /> <br />kinda the same concept as your script, but rather it being the latest perk it being the specific perk. <br /> <br /> <br />they did this in IW Zombies and itd be awesome to have here!</p>
