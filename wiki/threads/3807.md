<p>Hi, i&#39;m relatively new to Modding and my very first project is to make a custom weapon pack that works on original Zombie Maps. <br /><br />Any help would be really appreciated, expecially in the scripting part since i&#39;m trying to learn it.<br />So i know that, in order to customize box weapons in a custom map, i have to manage the levelcommon csv, which i take from the gamedata folder, put it into my map folder, and then edit the zm_usermap gsc/csc accordingly.<br /><br />But regarding stock maps, if i understand correctly, each map has its own table or csv file that i have to obtain, so they don&#39;t read from the levelcommon one, correct?<br /><br />I have installed HydraX since it can extracts the assets from the stock maps, so i started ripping the Kino Der Toten csv, which is named zm_theater_weapons.csv<br /><br />Now what i should precisely do in order to make it work in my mod? where i have to put it, how i have to structure the script? I can&#39;t find any tutorial that is clear regarding stock maps, only custom maps.<br /><br />Also, i have plans in editing the wallbuys, but i first want to understand correctly how to edit box weapons on stock maps.<br /><br />Thank you in advance, i really want to get into modding BO3 but at first glance it&#39;s difficult for someone thas has very little knowledge about coding, so as said before, any help would be really appreciated since it&#39;s the first time i&#39;m trying.</p>

How i should correctly add them? Since in my mod there&#39;s no folder about the sound or the scripts about the functioning/animations of the guns, i really need to know how to move.<br /><br />Thanks in advance! Ahy help is really appreciated in my way in trying to learn modding this amazing game</p>

<p>So I&#39;ve never done a standalone mod, so I have no clue how to get the sounds to work for custom weapons.<br />However to add custom weapons to stock maps, as far as I know, you have to get each individual zm_insertmapname_weapons.csv with hydra, and add your custom weapons to the box/ remove the old ones like harry said.<br />I just tested out revelations (zm_genesis_weapons.csv) and was able to add the weapons to the box easy, just none had sounds.<br />You would need to do that for each map.csv. you can copy and paste the changes from each, or give each map some unique weapons.<br />you&#39;d want to add each of them in this folder(you will need to make each of them them) gamedata\weapons\zm in your mods root folder.<br /><br />the zm_levelcommon_weapons.csv will replace custom map weapons. There is probably a way to set each map to this csv instead of adding all of them, but i don&#39;t know how.<br /><br />to add a custom weapon so it will show up, you also need to include the weapon in your .zone file as well<br />example of what that looks like:<br />weaponfull,vks    // weaponfile name in ape<br />weaponfull,vks_upgraded    // upgraded weaponfile name in ape<br />weaponfull,discgun    // weaponfile name in ape<br /><br />I haven&#39;t downloaded anyone&#39;s weapons, but I&#39;m sure they should be pretty drag and drop, and should include instructions for install.<br />I&#39;m sure someone will jump in and say how to include the weapon sounds properly, and correct me if I misspoke about something.<br />I also have no clue about changing wall weapons, sorry:/</p>

I guess it&#39;s something about scripting i have to do? i didn&#39;t do anything besides adding all the files into root folder and the lines in the ZONE/CSV.</p>

<p>That’s a issue with the port<br /><br />Make sure you’ve got the common asset pack too</p>

You could&#39;ve missed one of the folders by accident maybe?</p>

I loaded the mod, activated developer 2 in order to set 3rd person view, and the character model is fine, even the weapon itself, but is the 1st person view that is all screwed up as you can see in the image i posted before and the weapon doesn&#39;t work (it does fire but ammo count doesn&#39;t decrease, doesn&#39;t reload, also no sound since i don&#39;t have set it up yet). What i&#39;m missing? there&#39;s something different i have to do in order to make them work in stock maps?</p>

If you tried to reinstall that one and you have it installed correctly, try a different weapon just to make sure the commando isn&#39;t broken. I did nothing different to make my weapons work on rev when I first commented on the thread. I wanted to make sure I could get it to work before I tried to tell someone else how to.</p>

Could you maybe share the test you did on rev which does work with me, so i can compare it with what i have at moment? i think that may be the best solution</p>

I would recommend doing the verify file integrity check on steam, though that probably won&#39;t help. <br />The only thing I can think of at this point is you showing me what you are doing, because if you have everything setup and installed correctly it should be working. <br /><br />When building the mod, are you ticking compile and link? Not sure if that is the proper way, but it&#39;s what i&#39;ve been doing.<br /><br />You didn&#39;t tick all of the separate mods(core_mod/mp_mod/cp_mod/zm_mod) of your mod and try to build them all at once right? <br />I&#39;ve never had multi compile work for me. Try building just zm_mod. That is the only one I had built when I tested the weapons, and the weapon worked for me.</p>

<p><blockquote>Same result, must be something not set with anims, tried to preview and this happens as you can see from screenshot<br /><br />That&#39;s the problem, i think? i attached a screenshot<br /></blockquote><br /><a href="https://mega.nz/#!8WAhSQxI!S567tbj-gZLyecIkA3d5ATHSTIr-UcnwaqQ9CYb0Fpo">https://mega.nz/#!8WAhSQxI!S567tbj-gZLyecIkA3d5ATHSTIr-UcnwaqQ9CYb0Fpo</a><br />is this the one you downloaded? because it has the animmodel in it which is what you are missing.,<br />edit never mind, i thought you were showing the model attached to the anim and it was missing. That isn&#39;t the way to preview an anim, thats why you go that error.<br />use this model if you want to preview the anim:<br />c_t7_mp_warrior_viewarms1</p>

Still, did as you said, nothing happens, the gun basically is not previewed during the animation besides the arms which basically do nothing, like the model it isn&#39;t linked or something like that...<br />anyway guys i want to thank you for your patience and time in helping me, really</p>

<p><blockquote>Ok, previewed every animation, besides the gun not appearing, the arms models show correctly all of them, but ads_up and ads_down basically don&#39;t work<br /></blockquote><br />ads up and down are supposed to look strange in ape, they don&#39;t show the proper ads animation. They do some weird wobble esk animation correct?<br />The reason you only saw arms is because you only set the viewarms, not a weapon as well.<br />I&#39;m going to record a quick video showing you the exact process, if it still doesn&#39;t work for you then I&#39;m not sure what to recommend next.<br />Don&#39;t worry it will be unlisted, I&#39;m not trying to milk views or anything, plus I don&#39;t upload modding stuff.<br />edit also hats off for not just giving up like most new modders do when they can&#39;t figure something out.</p>

The proper attachment setup guide said &quot;now insert-user has a reason to use weaponfull&quot;. making it sound like there is no issue if you use it. That and me not having issues, made it seem like there was no problem, but I do get what you mean completely. <br />Like I said before I don&#39;t know a ton about modding, so I have no clue what people have and havent figured out.<br />I didn&#39;t even know until a couple months ago you can edit pretty much any stock script without the use of a mod. When I first looked into modding everyone said zm/powerups/spawner etc couldn&#39;t be edited without a mod. It isn&#39;t like there is a good centralized hub(at least that I know of haha) of solid info about bo3 modding.</p>
