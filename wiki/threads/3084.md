<p>Hi, I&#39;m asking for help with a script for a boss fight with the features.<br />&gt; That lasts 8 min.<br />&gt; To open a door at the end of time.<br />&gt; That generates 8 panzer soldat every 2 min.<br />&gt; That continuously generate zombies.<br />&gt; That plays a song.<br />I&#39;m asking for help since I don&#39;t know how the script works on a map and I would love to put this boss fighting on the map.<br />in return I can offer credits on the map, add him as the map contributor. I know it&#39;s not much, but I would really appreciate the help.<br /><br />my map progress is this: <br /><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2037701309">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2037701309</a></p>

<p>Hi, so I&#39;m using a similar boss fight in my map Blackwell Academy (<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1925931209">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1925931209</a> &lt;--- If you want to check it out xD)<br /><br />The fight starts when you touch a trigger, then when certain amount of time pass (8 min your case) a door open and show a text in screen.<br /><br />I try to add the music but I couldn&#39;t do it, so to fix it I put a musical ee teddy near the script so you can activate the song if you want or not.<br /><br />The only thing you need to do it&#39;s add the Panzer and zombie continuously spawn.<br /><br />Now, I made this script with try and error and using a lot of scripts to see how it works, so if there&#39;s any problem I can try to solve it but I know there&#39;s a lot of people here in the forum who can do it a thousands times better.<br /><br />Sorry for my english and hope it helps.<br /><br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
//Open your map GSC file and above "zm_usermap::main();" paste this:

//Boss Fight
thread boss_fight();


//At the bottom of the gsc paste this:

//Boss Fight
function boss_fight()
{
    trig = GetEnt("bf_trig","targetname");
    door = GetEnt("bf_door", "targetname");

    trig waittill("trigger", player);

    //Boss fight
    level flag::set( "spawn_zombies" ); //Start zombie spawn
    wait(480); //Fight time

    //Clear zombies
    zombies = zombie_utility::get_round_enemy_array();
        if ( isdefined( zombies ) )
        {
            array::run_all( zombies, &amp;Kill );
        }

    IPrintLnBold("DOOR OPEN"); //Messsage in screen
   
    door Delete(); //Delete door
    trig Delete(); //Delete trigger
}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br />After adding the script, open your map in Radiant and place a &quot;script_brushmodel&quot; using a clip texture with the targetname &quot;bf_door&quot;. This is the door that will dissapear after the fight.<br />Then add a &quot;script_multiple&quot; wherever you want to activate the fight. This will activate the fight when you touch the script.<br /><br />And that&#39;s it, just compile and link your map.</p>
