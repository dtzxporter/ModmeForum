<p>Thread By: Pepergogo<br />Hi!<br /> <br />I&#39;m making a challenge map and I want modify the power ups to this:<br />- All the power ups only work for the player who pick up (Blue power up)<br /> <br />- Red power ups: those who damage the other playes rather the one who pick up<br />- Red Max ammo: Empty the magazine of the other players<br />- Red Insta kill: Reduce health to 1 hit for the other players<br />- Red perk: Remove one perk for the other players<br /> <br />If anyone can help me to how can I make it that will be great<br />Thanks</p>
