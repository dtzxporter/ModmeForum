<p>Thread By: Abnormal202<br />so I&#39;m trying to create an easter egg in which players can turn on a generator for 30 seconds. While its on, player&#39;s have to defend it as zombies attack both the generator and players. Basically like the groph pods in Gorod Krovi. I&#39;ve tried a lot of different things, from Points of Interest, to level.attackables stuff, to setting zombies targeting differently but I&#39;m just not getting it to work. All I want are zombies to be able to attack and deal damage to a script_model for a time period. If anyone&#39;s got any ideas or wants to take a shot at this I&#39;d really appreciate it.</p>

<p>Reply By: Symbo<br />Hey! <br />I tried to do something similar rencently but didn t spend a lot a of time on it. You can create an attakable asset in ape and there is an attackable script.<br />Hope it helps. By the way If you find how to do it can you share or dm me?</p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />You could check how many zombies are withing a radius of the model every second and somehow calculate damage out of that.<br />As for making the zombies go to the model you can spam setgoal(); every 0.05 seconds or use <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
zombie.v_zombie_custom_goal_pos = model.origin;
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}

<p>Reply By: Symbo<br />Well to attract zombie it&#39;s easy: create a point of interrest. look at <br />zm_utility::create_zombie_point_of_interest( 2536, 100, 0 );<br />like for the monkeys, but they dont &quot;attack&quot;</p>

zombie ASMRequestSubstate( "melee@zombie" );
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 which will actually deal damage so if you setup the model to take damage it might. Not sure about this at all.</p>
