<p>Thread By: fusorf<br />Hey guys, I would like to have a single perk machine location (I only have one in my map) to switch to different perk machines every 5 rounds. I managed to do it in Waw back in the day, using a prefab provided by HarryBO21 and some scripting. But I have no idea how to do it in black ops 3.<br /><br />Thanks for the help ^^</p>
