<p>Thread By: Symbo<br />I have a map with drivable vehicles and, since i am not a good scripter, I decide to have many trigger multiple around the map for each lap and check if the player trigger them enough time to know when end the game.<br />But with this system a late players can finish the last lap even if he/she has 1 or more lap to do.<br />ZoekMeMarr helped me with a script recently that could solved that issue and can display the winner&#39;s name on screen. But this script doesn&#39;t work at all and I need help to understand why? <br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
