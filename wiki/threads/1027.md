<p>Thread By: FrankXu225<br />Hi guys! I&#39;m a newbie to BO3 mod tool and I haven&#39;t touch Radiant or GSC before. I have some experiences with C#(unity), LUA (LOVE2D) scripting. But when I&#39;m trying to learn GSC in BO3, I&#39;m kinda blocked and confused. I watched many scripting tutorials on YouTube from JBird, Uptown and many other awesome YouTubers. But most of those tutorials were using a pre-made prefab/scripts to achieve things. They didn&#39;t explain how each line work and why. Thus it&#39;s really hard for me to guess all the APIs and how to use them. Is there any doc, wiki or tutorial series teaching people how to do GSC from 0 to 1? Like write the first &quot;hello-world&quot; script then later use a trigger to start a lock-down zombie event? <br /> <br />I&#39;m trying to do the similar event from Shaow of Evil: after the player using a trigger, all doors lock and spawn ghost wizards. After the player kills all wizards, all doors unlock. Right now I can think the logic of this event, but I don&#39;t know how to use GSC and Radiant to implement my logic. And I don&#39;t know how to use triggers to spawn enemies. Or how to add those wizards into my level. So if you guys can help me out, you are much appreciated. :D<br /> <br />Anyway, BO3 Mod tools with GSC looks really powerful. To me it looks like a simplified unity, if there is a complete scripting tool, I&#39;m pretty sure it will be really helpful!<br /> <br />Thank you all in advance!</p>

<p>Reply By: Wild<br />Nate Smith wrote up a good beginner tutorial on his website.<br /> <br />You can find it here: <a href="http://natesmithzombies.com/wiki.html">http://natesmithzombies.com/wiki.html</a><br /> <br />I don&#39;t know how much it will help you with what you&#39;re trying to do but at least it gives you a better understanding of it I&#39;d assume.</p>

<p>Reply By: Scorpiolo<br />My best advice would be to read the treyarch scripts and those created by people like NateSmithZombies, it will give you a better understanding gradually</p>

<p>Reply By: FrankXu225<br />Thanks AGC and Scorpiolo!! Nate&#39;s website looks really helpful! I will try to learn from that!<br /> <br />And is there any doc or tutorial teaching how to interact a game object with functions? Like if I have a spawner and a trigger multiple in the game, how can I connect these two with a function? So I use the trigger, then the game calls the function, and the function makes the spawner spawn a zombie. Are there any examples like this?<br /><br />Meanwhile, is there any way I can read some scripts from the map Shadow of Evil? It looks like this map has the most complicated mechanics in all zombie modes. It&#39;s also possible this map is hard coded, but I really wish it&#39;s not...<br /><br />Anyway, thank you for the good advice!! I will try to discover more things and share with the community! You guys are awesome!!!</p>

my_trigger = GetEnt ("whatever","targetname");
//set the target name of your trigger in radiant to whatever
while(1)
{
  my_trigger waittil ("trigger",player);
  //what you want to happen
}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />MakeCents has a series of tutorials on how <a href="http://ugx-mods.com/forum/index.php/topic,14471.0.html">scripting interacts with radiant</a>.<br /> <br />You can also ask me any questions</p>

It works for me! I think I got the idea how to get an object from the editor then do things to it! <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://aviacreations.com/modme/emoticons/grin.png"></p>

I&#39;m trying to force spawn a zombie at a certain location, I used<br /> <br />guy=SpawnActor(&quot;actor_spawner_zm_factory_zombie&quot;,(-372,-624,156),(0, 0, 0));<br /> <br />but after the zombie spawned at the location, he just stands still. I think that&#39;s because he does not have the zombie AI. Is there any way to add AI to the zombie after spawning them? And from the doc I see SpawnActor() takes an argument of AIType, is there any way to check all AIType data in the game? I found in Radiant there are &quot;actor_spawner_zm_factory_zombie&quot; and &quot;actor_spawner_zm_factory_dog&quot;, but are there more? Like those flying wizards in Shadow of Evil map.<br /> <br />Thank you very much Abnormal202!!<img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://aviacreations.com/modme/emoticons/smile.png"></p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />yeah spawning zombies is one of the less convenient things to do. I got it working in my map, but I only had them spawn in the same zone as the player, not a specific point. Maybe you could get it working but I used the function found in zombie_utility.gsc :<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
function spawn_zombie( spawner,target_name,spawn_point,round_number) 
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
so since you&#39;re using a function from another script you have to put a:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
#using scripts\shared\ai\zombie_utility;
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
at the top of your GSC and use the function like:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
zombie = zombie_utility::spawn_zombie( spawner );
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
</p>
