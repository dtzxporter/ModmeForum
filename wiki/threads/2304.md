<p>Reply By: soul-toktzt<br /><blockquote><em>Zynx</em><br />This model pack includes all models from the Zombies In Spaceland map with the exclusion of bodies and weapons.   A fix for all strange normal maps will be released soon following the release of this thread.  Before this fix, some models may look wonky and have strange lines down the middle making it seem off. INSTALLATION: Move the &quot;texture_assets&quot;, &quot;source_data&quot;, and &quot;model_export&quot; folders into the Black Ops III root directory and make sure the folders will merge.   Find the models in APE to ensure if the import succeeded.   If any issues surface, please inform me on this thread.   CREDITS: DTZxPORTER for Wraith Treyarch/Activision for the models themselves :P   If you use these models in my map, please credit me and the names above.    </blockquote><br /> <br /> <br />1) Thank you very much for this :D This is awesome!<br /> <br />2) Didn&#39;t Infinity Ward made ZiS? ;)</p>

<p>Reply By: Wild<br />This is awesome! Any chance you&#39;d be doing this for Rave? I&#39;m only asking because I don&#39;t have the money to buy IW and the DLC on steam lol.</p>

Unless theres enough models new to do it I won&#39;t. I don&#39;t have Rave myself so buying it is a gamble.</p>
