<p>Thread By: Ahmed02354<br />[FIXED] whenever I walk into one room everything disappears? it is there in my modtools and whenever I build map and walk into that one room, the room is empty? (but it is there... But you can&#39;t see it) <br /> <br />If I stand on the other side of the room, things appear but when walking away it disappears again... I think a common bug? But how to fix this?</p>
