<p>Hi, <br /><br />I have been attempting to add some weapons to the bo3 vanilla maps. Im not directly taking the weapons from other games, i have been using skyes ww2 weapon pack so far and cannot seem to get the weapons to appear in the game. I have been trying to follow the wiki, but the wiki seems to be more geared for custom map creation instead of mod creation, as a result some steps dont seem to make sense to me.<br /><br />Any help would be greatly appreciated. I know some people have done similar mods but i haven&#39;t been able to figure this out for the life of me.</p>
