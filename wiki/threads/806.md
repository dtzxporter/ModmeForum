<p>Thread By: HATMANYO<br /><p style="text-align:left;">I have an idea for a perk I&#39;m going to call bullet brandy which makes it so you don&#39;t need to reload ad shooting takes form your stockpile before taking form you clip. I think the perk should be either 3000 points or 3500 points. I know there is a gobble gum that does this but I wanna perk that does it instead. How hard will it be to code and if I can have any help it will be appreciated.thx</p></p>

I dont want to code a perk that everyone cant use and I would want it to have a nice model so it looks professional. </p></p>

I think JBird has a tutorial on retexturing objects </p></p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br /><p style="text-align:left;">I don&#39;t understand. Isn&#39;t this just an overpowered version of Speed Cola? Seems too good to me, especially with weapons that normally have very small clips. Plus it would make buying Speed Cola completely obsolete. I feel like you should maybe change it to something less powerful. For instance, your bullets automatically move from the stock to your clip at a rate of 2 bullets/second or something like that. That way you don&#39;t have to reload as often as you should, but you can&#39;t just spam the entire clip and keep firing. It would also give speed cola a use again (if you even want to include it in your map). Just a thought.</p></p>

I agree that this will be too OP. Lets make something everyone will really think is balanced and fun </p></p>

So Natesmithzombies can you code it so bullets move from the stockpile to the clip.</p></p>
