<p>Thread By: TrueGamerCalls<br />I used Wraith to export the hazmat viewhands and player model and I was wondering how I can change the models to the one I exported from wraith.</p>

<p>Reply By: Dick_Nixon<br />It depends on what game you ripped them from, the BO1/BO2 hazmat suits are different to rig that the Ghosts suits. and, at that, you have to have some fairly decent knowledge in weight painting in maya. I&#39;d recommend checking out some tutorials on youtube(I believe from KommunityKod) or do some google searches.</p>
