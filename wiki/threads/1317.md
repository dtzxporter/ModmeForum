<p>Thread By: TCM<br />I was just randomly going through the points file I see where the case statements are talking about taking points for down,death etc, I was just wondering how would I go about taking say 1/4 of a players points for going down.</p>

 <br /> <br />this is a silly way of doing this however, as you already lose points when you down, so this will make you just lose 1/4 &quot;on top&quot; of what youre already losing - and doesnt use the &quot;callbacks&quot; system, so will not even run on players that hotjoined mid game or were simply slow connecting<br /> <br />if you had 50,000 youd end up losing like 28,000 or something ridiculous<br /> <br /> <br />what you should &quot;actually&quot; do is modify the &quot;designed to be modified&quot; stats<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
column = 2;
	zombie_utility::set_zombie_var( "penalty_no_revive", 				0.10, 	true,	column );	// Percentage of money you lose if you let a teammate die
	zombie_utility::set_zombie_var( "penalty_died",						0.0, 	true,	column );	// Percentage of money lost if you die
	zombie_utility::set_zombie_var( "penalty_downed", 					0.05, 	true,	column );	// Percentage of money lost if you go down // ww: told to remove downed point loss

 <br />these are from _zm.gsc<br /> <br />copy paste these to your mapname gsc underneath<br /> <br />zm_usermaps::main();<br /> <br />and change to whatever<br /> <br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
#using scripts\shared\ai\zombie_utility;
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />^ remember to include this<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />some people just refuse to read the existing code to find these things that already exist you see ( ohhh they claim to, yet they literally always miss these, and miss the callbacks - like on laststand, on death and on spawned... )</p>
