<p>I&#39;m porting the first blade from the show Supernatural into my map as a melee weapon to do so can I just copy the Bowie knife asset and ape and place it in my custom gdts and then overwrite the information with my first Blade model or should I set it up as a new asset as a melee asset also can I use the animations from the Bowie knife there are approximately the same size and shape? Once I have it ported in and working I will upload it here for anyone to use I don&#39;t really care about getting credit for it since I&#39;ll need help getting it in anyway yours to use however you wish.<br />I am trying to add my own textures since the file had none. The UV map projection may be problem so many faces. Will upload pic of that when I have them.<img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.366.jpg' | relative_url }}"><br /><br />Downloaded of Original file:<br /><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2111464">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2111464</a><br />Supernatural first blade by Gingerdude is licensed under the Creative Commons - Attribution license.<br /><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</a><br />This file is not my own i found it on myminifactory but i love the show and this site so i wanted to share<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.364.jpg' | relative_url }}"></p>

Might skin this myself. Easy done ;). I&#39;ve never ported a weapon in, but the modelling\skinning\uv&#39;s..I can do that. I have a hi-res image of the knife too, so it should look pretty sweet.</p>

I can only think that it&#39;s been scanned with some sort of photogrammetry or a 3d printer\scanner. Too many polygons\tris to make it a workable model. I&#39;ll see what I can find</p>
