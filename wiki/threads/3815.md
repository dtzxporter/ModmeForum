<p>To get right to it, I&#39;m still new and need some help. Here are my questions I hope someone can answer.<br />[LIST=1]<br /><li>Is there any way I can make an Fx only occur during any round you set it to?<br /><li>I made an Fx and it only activates when a player is looking directly at it, is there a way to make it always active, or have it always active when in a certain zone?<br /><li>Is there any way I can make a trigger_hurt or any trigger at all only occur during any round I set it to?<br /></li></li></li>[/LIST]</p>
