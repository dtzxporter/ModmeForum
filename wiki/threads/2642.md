<p>I figured some new mappers might enjoy a tutorial that goes over some of the less talked about aspects of lighting a map, as well as some of the variables you can tweek to get your lights looking exactly how you want them to.<br /><br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tyOdxl-14F0" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br />The tutorial itself is fairly comprehensive, and easy to follow, and covers both omni and spot lights.<br /><br />I hope this helps you guys and if you would like any more tutorials on other topics, just let me know.<br /><br />Feel free to post your lighting in this thread, and if you&#39;d like, some before and afters if this helped you achieve what youre looking for.<br /><br />Map files are attached to the thread. Just create a new multiplayer map called mp_lighting and copy and paste the contents of the zip into your BO3 directory.</p>
