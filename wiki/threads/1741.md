<p>Thread By: Abnormal202<br />So I&#39;m calling this the &quot;dirty&quot; screen glitch, because it is really hard to explain with words, but basically it makes you want to wipe down the screen of your computer, because this glitch makes it look dirty.<br /><br />Its hard to explain but basically whenever you move your view these &quot;dirty&quot; looking (shadows?) stay on the screen for a couple of seconds. They seem to come from the outline of other objects you were previously looking at.<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i64.tinypic.com/zmys7r.jpg"><br /><br />Here you can see I was previously staring at a fence (its basically just a bunch of poles in the ground at different angles) and when I looked away it left that mark on the screen for a little bit.<br /><br />If anyone else has been experiencing these problems or knows how to fix it, I&#39;d appreciate any help.</p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />I added reflection probes all around the map, and in the unplayable sections too, but it didn&#39;t seem to help. Its possible I&#39;m not doing it right, but its hard to find a good tutorial on lighting and reflection probes at the moment; and they are very different from World at War.</p>

I turned it off and it seemed to work. Thanks</p>
