<p>Thread By: SpeedBeam<br /><p style="text-align:left;">I need help with this. I used the Mr. Hanky&#39;s script placer and it seems like its the one causing the issue. But overall, I also need to figure out the multiple round starts like in many other mods (Encampment V2 for example), if I use multiple lines using chalk it says its a duplicate line.</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">And also, add custom voices? I want to add all of the voices from The Giant to WaW.</p></p>
