<p>Listen Harry lad. You deleted his website over an argument, correct?<br />That&#39;s pretty childish to do, while he may have not impressed you with him taking a while, you personally went around it the wrong way.<br />Having a tantrum like this isn&#39;t how it should be dealt with at all. Shoulda kept private, and if it was over then it should&#39;ve been left that way.<br />End of the day, Kyle probably had a lot more shit to do in real life, not everyone wants to focus on modding. <br />Personal shit aside, you should&#39;ve kept this private, and honestly need to grow up a bit. It may just be in your best interest to take a break from modding as a whole lad.<br />Because Kyle is right, he was the only person who stuck beside you when 99% of the other people couldn&#39;t stand you due to how you act, and you&#39;ve just lost that last person who wanted to give you a chance. Especially after falsely accusing someone of a serious crime, on top of being so stubborn that you were innocent on everything. I&#39;m really surprised you&#39;ve posted all this to try and prove innocence when you genuinely can&#39;t prove you were an angel like you lead everyone to believe.<br /><br />Best to get some counseling because you seem to explode over the smallest of things, and it could genuinely help you realise why people don&#39;t wanna be around you.<br />This isn&#39;t to be condescending, or hostile, this is me trying to actually help you see you need to improve as a person, as others have done.</p>

<p>Hot damn what a wild fucking ride this was. I&#39;m honestly really glad I just did my own thing and didn&#39;t engage with the modding community, at least not this side of it. A lot of you seem like really toxic people to interact with and are acting like children. The fact that this thread even exists is really telling. Harry, I agree with 762NATO in that you should get some help. The messages you posted made you out to be very toxic toward Kyle, even if there&#39;s reason to be upset or angry at him, he&#39;s still a human who should be treated with some form of respect. Likely why a lot of people are assholes to you is that you don&#39;t show them the respect they deserve. That&#39;s not to say they were justified, but it at least helps explain where they are coming from, hell I could see myself in a moment of weakness being an asshole back to you if you treated me like you did Kyle. I think its best for you to take a break and seek some help dude<br /><br />- A random lurker</p>

<p>Yes people who send abusive murder dog videos and harass people for 7+ years posting pictures of their house of google maps and relentlessly beating you up over a divorce or posting thousands of memes of my face calling me a paedo despite at least one of them legitimately trying to be one then suddenly start acting all concerned over my mental health really deserve to be “listened to and respected” yea…<br /><br />Literally if any proper authority ever investigated these cretins they’d be in jail for years for the vulgar content they have and share ( or force on victims ) or the sheer abuse, harassment and outing people’s personal information<br /><br />Or joining madgaz streams to send donations that insult or degrade his baby daughter and family - then file for a refund on PayPal for every one<br /><br />They are sick sick puppies mate, they literally get off on “gore” and sending said gore to minors - that should tell you all you need to know<br /><br />You clearly have no idea what the people responding to this thread are really like<br /><br />As for Kyle, he did nothing but try to make life hard or dismiss anything I said for over 6 entire months and REFUSED to let me leave the project and remove MY work from it so I couldn’t care less if his fee fees were hurt - they hated him as much as me - but he’s forgotten all that and all the outrageous stuff they done/doing and pally palled up to them all. His use for me declined, so he treated me like a complete cunt till I left coz he thinks the entire world revolves around his constant and consistent level of happy<br /><br />And let’s not forget his entire reason for the project was to make it “perfect” - but then did numerous things wrong or not at all “on purpose”, refused to keep any kind of order to the direction of the project ( seemingly jumping from one half finished thing to the next or to COMPLETELY UNRELATED THINGS ), spent most his time messing around with stuff he doesn’t understand which just meant every time I tried to work I had to redo stuff or change stuff to even be able to work ( usually because it was just not named his way or had a English spelling which he would insist on changing in all files back to American even tho we are both fucking English!!! ), ignored COMPLETED WORK just coz “in his opinion” there was “no personal benefit to him to just do something that would take a second and keep everyone happy” or just did nothing at all claiming to be “too busy” yet spent like 5000 hours playing games<br /><br />Then the website, everyone is acting outraged that I deleted it. Firstly that’s exactly what others here have done before yet they are not judged at all, plus Kyle literally couldn’t care less about the site, registration was locked, the things we planned - were never added, all the boards etc were set up by me and 95% of the content on there? Was all mine anyway. He literally did not give half a shit about the site. It existed yes, you could download links of it yes, but you couldn’t post, you couldn’t report bugs or share yourself without first jumping through hoops to even get a fucking account ffs…<br /><br />If you’d rather refuse to do something over and over that would literally take seconds - knowing that it will eventually cause all this - you ARE an asshole who cannot work in a team ( hell he doesn’t WORK at all! )<br /><br />Talk to me about respect when you’ve had 10+ ppl relentlessly attack you in the deepest possible ways non stop for literally years, forcing you to appear offline for literally years and delete shit like Skype and refuse any friend request you get coz it’s usually just them on alt accounts trying yet again to attack you when you haven’t even been active for a year etc in a attempt to distance yourself from it<br /><br />The problem is half and half - end of story<br /><br />I’ve done my part fine, they’ve done one million times what I ever will <br /><br />On nearly all occasions I’ve had to “accept my faults” so fine yea I’m a terrible person. But these absolute scumbags never have, never will, consistently just blame each other and ONLY RETURN FOR THIS KIND OF DRAMA - if you actually believed them - none of them are responsible for any of the ten years of abuse they have caused and it must just be imaginary. Even all the recorded conversations, pictures, messages, chats, posts and the rest - they literally just twist it, pretend they had nothing to do with it or claim their mate used their log in or pretend it isn’t one of their accounts etc etc etc all the whole acting absolutely outraged then suddenly act like composed genuinely worried citizens who are so pure of heart? It is and always will be a complete fucking lie<br /><br />Even when they “have admitted” things they did they expect to just be able to claim some personal issue like drugs or livelihood to get away with it. If they do something wrong - it’s not their fault EVER - but you do something - and have a similar personal issue yourself - your issue doesn’t matter and you should be harassed for years and just need to kill yourself?<br /><br />The end of the day mate, even when I leave for literally years, they still track me and follow me by any means they can, concocting more conspiracy theories or lies because - as they’ve said before - their goal isn’t for me to leave it’s too make me kill myself lol - get some perspective<br /><br />This is one of the most toxic and abusive places out there whether I’m in it or not and the sort of shit they do here should make your blood boil as in many many cases it can only be described as harassment threats and malicious digital crime<br /><br />Over a fucking game kids ( which half of them even now are not old enough to even buy… )<br /><br />And don’t be fooled, they think their age removes any responsibility they bare towards their own CRIME<br /><br />Might wanna check the dates next time you get involved too - I left all modding shite months ago, I only saw this coz of a notification. If you wanna tell someone to go seek “help” or “take a break” maybe consider oh shit they’ve been gone like 50 days maybe they already are! Or you are as bad as them ( this has gone on years, over various apps and sites, you know literally nothing about the other side of the story )<br /><br />Also these “fellow modders” that are literally ALWAYS involved in literally every fucking drama going - it must be no surprise they have had next to nothing to do with actual modding or projects in years. They stay just to ensure they can force people away, force a divide in the community and keep it as dodgy and fucked as it is. They’ve outright said in the past they think this is a “dead game” and they just want to see the community fail<br /><br />And to everyone slagging me off for removing my own hard work or thinking I’m just some asshole so you can release all my work coz that’s more acceptable? Show me any fucking releases from these cunts - you will find next to nothing and what you do find will be years ago. Also the people reposting all my links because they claim it’s the “right thing to do” are the very same cunts who constantly and consistently slag my work off calling it rubbish and telling people not to use it<br /><br />They themselves, do fuck all for you lot ( as opposed to me who made EVERYTHING FREE AND PUBLIC ) - they pally up to ppl who can do the amazing shit, then form a barrier around that person to ENSURE no one else can be part of the group - and ensure all “talent” is blocked off within their own private circle of top quality abusive bastards <br /><br />They literally make no fucking sense and take whatever approach or stance that will either incorrectly make people think they are normal composed human beings or cause as much emotional damage as fucking possible<br /><br />Fuck me there’s about 1000 pictures of me with captions saying I touch kids despite the fact I never have, yet one of them actually admitting wanting to meet a 15 year old on a school trip to the uk - then they act like it’s crossing a line to insinuate anything about him?<br /><br />Put that in perspective too, the thing that’s pissed these ppl off most for me, was me “finally” calling out the legit nonce, sent them crazy. Just consider that, the people spreading accusations you touch kids memes all over the fucking internet about me ( who they’ve never met ) is ok, or should be ok coz they were addict or going through some emotional distress, but me pointing out a actual conversation they were all fucking in - oh that was too much ( no care about the pandemic, the fact I was locked up alone in some middle of nowhere village, broke, divorced and very fucking sick with covid or whether I was a addict or mentally “unwell - none of that matters - only THEIR issues can matter )<br /><br />If “I” am sick simply for having a temper then these guys should be classed as maniacally insane beyond any reason<br /><br />Hell he points me out over coyote ( who is mentally unsound so jumping to join in with no idea what’s even going on usually ) about me picking on him but they’ve literally tormented the kid for fucking years, there are thousands ( yes literally ) of pictures of him they’ve gathered with abusive captions, they’ve made fake accounts to friend him, even gone so far as to argue with his fucking mother about them abusing him on a fucking voice call - and they call me out on that and act as if they would never ever do what I did?

They use your trauma or sensitive info as a weapon - then use theirs as some half assed defence? It’s laughable <br /><br />The fact that all new sites / discord’s / etc use their previous actions as things you are not allowed by the rules to do should speak volumes about why we even have to make said rules - as to a normal healthy human being you shouldn’t even need to be fucking told not to ddos or send grotesque shit to other humans for kicks<br /><br />Their MO - is to encapture the talented ppl and turn them in to them, it’s happened numerous times. Kyle is just the latest person to fall in to their trap, within 3/4 months he will be up to the same as them, just has happened with every other person. It had clearly already started, hence why he literally “enjoyed” fucking me off or blaming me for everything and telling every other person in the chats that their opinions don’t matter and therefore should be ignored<br /><br />Could literally argue about all this shit all day but it would be for nothing as explained above. So I’ve left, just like you all wanted. Even that’s not good enough for them tho - apparently it would have been more acceptable for me to go but leave all ten years of my hard work up for all the people that hate me? Yea makes total fucking sense</p>

<p><blockquote>Yes people who send abusive murder dog videos and harass people for 7+ years posting pictures of their house of google maps and relentlessly beating you up over a divorce or posting thousands of memes of my face calling me a paedo despite at least one of them legitimately trying to be one then suddenly start acting all concerned over my mental health really deserve to be “listened to and respected” yea…<br /><br />Literally if any proper authority ever investigated these cretins they’d be in jail for years for the vulgar content they have and share ( or force on victims ) or the sheer abuse, harassment and outing people’s personal information<br /><br />Or joining madgaz streams to send donations that insult or degrade his baby daughter and family - then file for a refund on PayPal for every one<br /><br />They are sick sick puppies mate, they literally get off on “gore” and sending said gore to minors - that should tell you all you need to know<br /><br />You clearly have no idea what the people responding to this thread are really like<br /><br />As for Kyle, he did nothing but try to make life hard or dismiss anything I said for over 6 entire months and REFUSED to let me leave the project and remove MY work from it so I couldn’t care less if his fee fees were hurt - they hated him as much as me - but he’s forgotten all that and all the outrageous stuff they done/doing and pally palled up to them all. His use for me declined, so he treated me like a complete cunt till I left coz he thinks the entire world revolves around his constant and consistent level of happy<br /><br />And let’s not forget his entire reason for the project was to make it “perfect” - but then did numerous things wrong or not at all “on purpose”, refused to keep any kind of order to the direction of the project ( seemingly jumping from one half finished thing to the next or to COMPLETELY UNRELATED THINGS ), spent most his time messing around with stuff he doesn’t understand which just meant every time I tried to work I had to redo stuff or change stuff to even be able to work ( usually because it was just not named his way or had a English spelling which he would insist on changing in all files back to American even tho we are both fucking English!!! ), ignored COMPLETED WORK just coz “in his opinion” there was “no personal benefit to him to just do something that would take a second and keep everyone happy” or just did nothing at all claiming to be “too busy” yet spent like 5000 hours playing games<br /><br />Then the website, everyone is acting outraged that I deleted it. Firstly that’s exactly what others here have done before yet they are not judged at all, plus Kyle literally couldn’t care less about the site, registration was locked, the things we planned - were never added, all the boards etc were set up by me and 95% of the content on there? Was all mine anyway. He literally did not give half a shit about the site. It existed yes, you could download links of it yes, but you couldn’t post, you couldn’t report bugs or share yourself without first jumping through hoops to even get a fucking account ffs…<br /><br />If you’d rather refuse to do something over and over that would literally take seconds - knowing that it will eventually cause all this - you ARE an asshole who cannot work in a team ( hell he doesn’t WORK at all! )<br /><br />Talk to me about respect when you’ve had 10+ ppl relentlessly attack you in the deepest possible ways non stop for literally years, forcing you to appear offline for literally years and delete shit like Skype and refuse any friend request you get coz it’s usually just them on alt accounts trying yet again to attack you when you haven’t even been active for a year etc in a attempt to distance yourself from it<br /><br />The problem is half and half - end of story<br /><br />I’ve done my part fine, they’ve done one million times what I ever will<br /><br />On nearly all occasions I’ve had to “accept my faults” so fine yea I’m a terrible person. But these absolute scumbags never have, never will, consistently just blame each other and ONLY RETURN FOR THIS KIND OF DRAMA - if you actually believed them - none of them are responsible for any of the ten years of abuse they have caused and it must just be imaginary. Even all the recorded conversations, pictures, messages, chats, posts and the rest - they literally just twist it, pretend they had nothing to do with it or claim their mate used their log in or pretend it isn’t one of their accounts etc etc etc all the whole acting absolutely outraged then suddenly act like composed genuinely worried citizens who are so pure of heart? It is and always will be a complete fucking lie<br /><br />Even when they “have admitted” things they did they expect to just be able to claim some personal issue like drugs or livelihood to get away with it. If they do something wrong - it’s not their fault EVER - but you do something - and have a similar personal issue yourself - your issue doesn’t matter and you should be harassed for years and just need to kill yourself?<br /><br />The end of the day mate, even when I leave for literally years, they still track me and follow me by any means they can, concocting more conspiracy theories or lies because - as they’ve said before - their goal isn’t for me to leave it’s too make me kill myself lol - get some perspective<br /><br />This is one of the most toxic and abusive places out there whether I’m in it or not and the sort of shit they do here should make your blood boil as in many many cases it can only be described as harassment threats and malicious digital crime<br /><br />Over a fucking game kids ( which half of them even now are not old enough to even buy… )<br /><br />And don’t be fooled, they think their age removes any responsibility they bare towards their own CRIME<br /><br />Might wanna check the dates next time you get involved too - I left all modding shite months ago, I only saw this coz of a notification. If you wanna tell someone to go seek “help” or “take a break” maybe consider oh shit they’ve been gone like 50 days maybe they already are! Or you are as bad as them ( this has gone on years, over various apps and sites, you know literally nothing about the other side of the story )<br /><br />Also these “fellow modders” that are literally ALWAYS involved in literally every fucking drama going - it must be no surprise they have had next to nothing to do with actual modding or projects in years. They stay just to ensure they can force people away, force a divide in the community and keep it as dodgy and fucked as it is. They’ve outright said in the past they think this is a “dead game” and they just want to see the community fail<br /><br />And to everyone slagging me off for removing my own hard work or thinking I’m just some asshole so you can release all my work coz that’s more acceptable? Show me any fucking releases from these cunts - you will find next to nothing and what you do find will be years ago. Also the people reposting all my links because they claim it’s the “right thing to do” are the very same cunts who constantly and consistently slag my work off calling it rubbish and telling people not to use it<br /><br />They themselves, do fuck all for you lot ( as opposed to me who made EVERYTHING FREE AND PUBLIC ) - they pally up to ppl who can do the amazing shit, then form a barrier around that person to ENSURE no one else can be part of the group - and ensure all “talent” is blocked off within their own private circle of top quality abusive bastards<br /><br />They literally make no fucking sense and take whatever approach or stance that will either incorrectly make people think they are normal composed human beings or cause as much emotional damage as fucking possible<br /><br />Fuck me there’s about 1000 pictures of me with captions saying I touch kids despite the fact I never have, yet one of them actually admitting wanting to meet a 15 year old on a school trip to the uk - then they act like it’s crossing a line to insinuate anything about him?<br /><br />Put that in perspective too, the thing that’s pissed these ppl off most for me, was me “finally” calling out the legit nonce, sent them crazy. Just consider that, the people spreading accusations you touch kids memes all over the fucking internet about me ( who they’ve never met ) is ok, or should be ok coz they were addict or going through some emotional distress, but me pointing out a actual conversation they were all fucking in - oh that was too much ( no care about the pandemic, the fact I was locked up alone in some middle of nowhere village, broke, divorced and very fucking sick with covid or whether I was a addict or mentally “unwell - none of that matters - only THEIR issues can matter )<br /><br />If “I” am sick simply for having a temper then these guys should be classed as maniacally insane beyond any reason<br /><br />Hell he points me out over coyote ( who is mentally unsound so jumping to join in with no idea what’s even going on usually ) about me picking on him but they’ve literally tormented the kid for fucking years, there are thousands ( yes literally ) of pictures of him they’ve gathered with abusive captions, they’ve made fake accounts to friend him, even gone so far as to argue with his fucking mother about them abusing him on a fucking voice call - and they call me out on that and act as if they would never ever do what I did? Yet they’ve down a monumental amount worse and probably still are?<br /><br />Let me guess, it’s ok for them coz they were young, or they were hooked on pain killers, or they had some recent trauma<br /><br />This is what they do!

<p>Harry. You go on mad ones when people give feedback and say somethings broken on your packs. And wonder why people call you an asshole.<br /><br />Lets break this down<br /><br />We&#39;ll go over the &quot;pedo&quot; shit first.<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1165.png' | relative_url }}"><br />So this claim, I know who it&#39;s against, and you&#39;ve not got one shred of evidence for it, because none exists. That&#39;s a false accusation that you batted around to try have people go against that person, for what I don&#39;t know, but you became utterly obsessed with throwing that claim around when you yourself know its false.<br /><br />Coyote stuff<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1166.png' | relative_url }}"><br />You&#39;ve proved my point with the &quot;who is mentally unsound.&quot; How fucking bigoted can you be. He&#39;s a normal lad with a mild learning difficulty, who&#39;s got a passion for doing things in mod tools, because thats what his disability makes him hyperfixate on. You&#39;re mixing 2 different groups up into one and saying we all do the same shit. For one, I&#39;ve not even spoke to Coyote&#39;s mother, and he can confirm that himself, I&#39;ve had some jokes with him in private servers, but we&#39;ve always been friendly to one another. As have the rest of the group I talk to. Sanchez&#39;s group are a different story, and we are NOT associated with them, considering they all have us blocked anyway lmao.<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1167.png' | relative_url }}"><br />I like this one. Because its hypocrisy. You&#39;ve countless times bitched about your traumas and then given shit to other peoples on theirs. And since you mentioned my issue (year and a half clean btw!!!) I&#39;ll give you this. Not once would I have gone directly at you for your divorce. It&#39;s a shame things like that can happen, and from someone who&#39;s from a shit background it&#39;s rough.<br />The &quot;young&quot; excuse is more pertaining to a lad of 14 finding gore funny which obviously is a bit scuffed. he grew out of it.<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1168.png' | relative_url }}"><br />You spoke to Kyle like utter shit in all those screenshots. He constantly stuck by you when people turned away due to your behaviour. And after everything you just try to make him out to be the devil. He&#39;s a good guy, and a chill person to talk to. I&#39;ve never personally had an issue with Kyle, nor have many of my group. It was you trying to create those issues so you could keep us away from any modding related server because you didn&#39;t like us. Pretty childish thing.<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1169.png' | relative_url }}"><br />Funny because you went through my twitter after ages of no contact to go off and try ridicule me over shit which I&#39;d posted 3 months prior. Like that sounds like obsession to me. I couldn&#39;t give a shit less. You just wanted to try spark some shit up considering the server you went in, you knew we had some friends in there anyway. You wanted drama, and then you complain when it happens? give it a break.<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1170.png' | relative_url }}"><br />I&#39;ve been in the community since maybe &#39;17. A lot of shit stems back to WaW days, which a lot of shit was pretty out of line, and that&#39;s more the shit that was given to you, but again you lump a ton of people with that when that was GunOfTruth who was doing that, fuckin no one likes him lmao<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1171.png' | relative_url }}"><br />GunOfTruth&#39;s friend Kyle. OneInchPunisher etc. Again that shit was fucking despicable. but i mean no one talks to him besides those guys either.<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1172.png' | relative_url }}"><br />Specifically this &quot;too busy part&quot;:<br />If I&#39;m remembering right, Kyle has kids, yes? You say he&#39;s &quot;busy playing games&quot; but he&#39;s easily just looking after his kids or working, it&#39;s not really an unreasonable thing to look after your children.<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1173.png' | relative_url }}"><br />You deleted them because someone told you something was broken, which it was. And you couldn&#39;t accept that. instead of asking how to reproduce the issues and being willing to fix it.<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1174.png' | relative_url }}"><br />That &quot;legit nonce&quot; isn&#39;t a nonce at all. It was a false claim brought up by you to discredit and destroy that persons reputation which honestly was pretty downright fucked.<br />You cannot ever complain that you&#39;re falsely being called a nonce, when you yourself have done that to someone else, and relentlessly. Whereas your face just got stuck on a meme.<br /><br /><br />And in reply to &quot;turning talented people into them&quot;<br />No one actively speaks to Kyle, I speak to him on occasion, he&#39;s a chill guy<br />No one is trying to &quot;turn people into others&quot; you donut. <br />That being said, you can leave. Just don&#39;t expect to be able to get away with your false accusations against people.</p>

Regardless if it’s true or not ( which it is and you know it )<br /><br />As for Twitter, I don’t even know who the fuck is who and only looked coz someone sent me it <br /><br />Lol pathetic man<br /><br />Whatever, as I said I left ages ago, just like years ago when I left and you scumbags still hounded me the entire year lol<br /><br />Sad sad kiddos<br /><br />Also I deleted my shit as soon as you reposted them, nothing to do with it being broken. But you guys put it straight back up anyway make your mind up!<br /><br />And as for Kyle, your “group” whether you claim are not longer associated or not treated Kyle far FAR worse than I ever did until I posted this - again pick a fucking side not just whatever one I’m not on<br /><br />You are COMPLETELY bias<br /><br /><br />I stress again, I left ages ago - just like you wanted<br /><br />Is that not enough?  <br /><br />If you want me to stay gone - I’ll happily ablige.
