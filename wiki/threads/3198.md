<p>I have a lot of problems with the maps that I have created after installing the Harry bo21 perks v5.<br /><br />I know, this problem happens in WaW, but I don&#39;t find any solution :(<br /><br />When I create a map, compile the level, the patch and build the mod everything is ok, but when I run the map I get the error &quot;unknown function&quot;, even in the maps that do not use any prefab of the mod. (Clarification: this happens on every map created after I installed the mod)<br /><br />I feel like it has ruined a map that I have worked on for weeks, I am very frustrated and want to know if it can be fixed<br /><br />Anyone help?</p>
