<p>Thread By: _Mr. Unp3rf3ct<br />Which scripts do I need to edit to change the display name of my map from zm_&quot;mapname&quot; to &quot;Mapname&quot;? Also how do I add a picture and Mission briefing? Am I just blind, because I see maps with names and briefings on the workshop, but no tutorial how to change it. Also i already read through all the map related scripts that I could find.<br /> <br />Help would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />Mapname is the Steam workshop name (doesn&#39;t show when you have the map selected and waiting for other players)<br />Mission briefing is the Steam workshop description<br />Pictures are in Call of Duty Black Ops III\usermaps\zm_mapname\zone loadingimage.png and previewimage.png</p>
