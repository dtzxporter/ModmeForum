<p>Thread By: avonian<br />I&#39;m trying to recreate the Hell&#39;s Retriever<br /><br />I have the xmodels, xanims, just need to know how to make projectiles in A.P.E.<br /><br />I know that you probably have to use a projectileweapon instead of bulletweapon,<br /><br /> I&#39;d set up everything that I would do normally with a bulletweapon that I&#39;m able to,<br /><br />I would get in game and the anims would would except I don&#39;t know how to officially<br /><br />make it a projectile that you can throw. Thanks in advance, Aven</p>

<p>Reply By: xSanchez78<br />It&#39;s not a projectile weapon, its a grenade weapon. Just go through the file setting by setting and eventually you will get it. One thing though: I don&#39;t think you realize or not, but there is a SHIT ton of script behind how the hell&#39;s retriever works. It won&#39;t work with JUST the weapon file if that&#39;s what you were thinking.</p>
