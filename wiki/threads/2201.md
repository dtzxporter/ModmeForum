<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br /><blockquote><em>Fil he Modder</em><br /> How was i supposed to know?! </blockquote><br /> because &quot;work in progress&quot; implies the work is already in progress, not just in concept stage.<br /> <br />I can understand why you might want to say when you&#39;re starting on a remake however, so that you can &quot;claim&quot; the remake and other people are less likely to work on something someone else is already doing.</p>
