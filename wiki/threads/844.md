<p>Thread By: LLamaMods101<br /><p style="text-align:left;">so i have created a part of &quot;five&quot; the part with the elevator and i was wondering how i could get the whole elevator to move not just a platform like in zombiekids elevator pack thing, i tried to just to put in a model with the target name (the same as the platform in the prefab) but nothing happened</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">be sick if someone could help :)</p></p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br /><p style="text-align:left;">All the parts of the elevator you want to move should be either script_models or script_brushmodels, all with the same targetname. In script you&#39;re going to need to use an array. I don&#39;t know what script you&#39;re currently using, so if you could post that, I could probably change it to use an array instead.</p></p>
