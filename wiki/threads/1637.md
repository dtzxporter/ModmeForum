<p>Thread By: The Black Death<br />Okay, so for the past few days I&#39;ve been trying to rip the LV8 Basilisk and bring it to ZM, but with two specific animations;<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
vm_pulse_rifle_idle
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
and<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
vm_pulse_rifle_fire_hold
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />I simply cannot get them to work properly. I can confirm that with the same anim rig, all the other LV8 Basilisk anims are working fine. I&#39;m not sure what the problem is here. They just refuse to sit in the hands properly and are way too far back.<br />Screenshot:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://oi68.tinypic.com/69m2vn.jpg"><br /> <br /> <br /><em>This issue has been occuring for me since I installed SETools v2.1.2 - as this <strong>could </strong>be the cause, I&#39;ll downgrade to 2.1.1 to see if it works then. If it does I&#39;ll inform Porter.</em></p>

<p>Reply By: The Black Death<br />Notably I was unaware that v2.1.4 had been released before this post - but this does not fix the problem.</p>

<p>Reply By: The Black Death<br /><strong>Can confirm an issue with 2.1.2 and above Porter - downgrading to 2.1.1 has fixed the issue. Possibly the rotation fix you made in 2.1.2 is the culprit?</strong></p>

<p>Reply By: The Black Death<br />It turns out I didn&#39;t zero the rotation for the parent joints - however now in SETools v2.1.5 it&#39;ll do this for you when you Attach Weapon to Rig.<br /> <br />Thanks Porter - you can close the post now :)</p>
