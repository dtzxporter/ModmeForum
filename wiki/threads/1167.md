<p>Thread By: vampehtwist<br />Hey, I have been looking around and through the docs and haven&#39;t had much luck so I&#39;m hoping someone here would be able to help me out. What I am trying to do through a mod/scripting is to change the lighting/skybox of all multiplayer maps to something dark and spooky like with fog if possible for a game mode I am working on any help would be much appreciated thanks.</p>
