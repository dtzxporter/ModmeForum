<p>So understanding this will be very beneficial to me so i can implement it into any trigger I like. I want to add a sound to opening my door, similar to the sound that plays on nacht when you open the classic sliding door. I have all the sound files I need, they&#39;re in my alias, I just need to know how to add it to my doors trigger. Thanks &#128513;</p>

<p>Looking at _zm_blockers.gsc it looks like if you set the kvp script_sound it will play the sound set, worth a try.</p>

I will have a look at that script to see if i can find anything else tho. Thanks dude</p>

<p>Literally just make a KVP on the trigger for your doors, &#39;<strong><span style="color:rgb(84, 172, 210);">script_sound</span></strong>&#39; being the key, and the name of your sound as defined in your sound alias as the value. Shouldn&#39;t be that hard tbh</p>
