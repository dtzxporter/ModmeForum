<p>Thread By: Cowman<br />Every time I have an terrain brush selected in radiant it goes white and when its not selected it has weird black lines going along it any help would be appreciated :)<br /> <br />Not selected:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/2a96d87e2dec3153097c58f1bf7f46c4.jpg"><br /> <br />Selected:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/96da7e23cbbfced6380148a5c4de52fb.jpg"><br /> <br />I&#39;m also on Fulbright in radiant and in game view it looks the same</p>

<p>Reply By: Cowman<br />I ended up fixing the issue I just had to use the &#39;Nuke Registry Settings&#39; in the radiant settings.</p>
