<p>So I&#39;ve never released a map on steam, can I upload it without it getting posted to the workshop for testing co-op?<br />I don&#39;t want to accidentally release my map without it being fully tested haha.<br />Is it better to upload the map to steam workshop for testing, or is it better to just share the zone folder with people? <br />Since people have access to everyones in the workshop, I assume it isn&#39;t a big deal to share it.</p>

<p>when you upload it to the workshop, it gets set to private. Then you can open the workshop and change it to friends, unlisted, or public</p>
