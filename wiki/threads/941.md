<p>Thread By: Noah Gamerscore<br />So I&#39;m making Zombie Desert Remastered and I need to know how to change the hellhounds health to a higher health. If anyone could help, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you<br /> <br />Here is the link to my map if anyone wants to try it out :<br /><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=884473262">http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=884473262</a></p>

<p>Reply By: dkamasta<br />I have that in my insanity mod, just add the dog.gsc and csc into your map.gsc and csc and also in zone. Then change health of dogs in dogs.gsc=easy</p>
