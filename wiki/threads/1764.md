<p>Thread By: Ieuan<br />I have converted a lot of CODWAW sound assets, and included an amended user_aliases.csv.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Some of these files I have used in my released map, all have been converted so they should be good to go.....remember to read the readme.txt file if you are unsure where these files are to be placed.<br /><br /><br /><br />Download link: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwMpdOR2ABDOSUg0WlZyalpjZkE">Download</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em>// Mod edit: You must wrap downloads in [ download ] tags!
