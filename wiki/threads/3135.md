If you just want to adjust a material, you do it in APE under &quot;Albedo Tint&quot;, underneath your Color Map.<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.619.png' | relative_url }}"><br /><br />However, if you want to Change the sky Color, you do that under SSI.<br />I suggest you take a copy of one of the base SSI (set the filters to SSI on &quot;types&quot;, and type &quot;default&quot; in &quot;Name&quot; (as below).<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.621.png' | relative_url }}"><br /><br />Once you have duplicated one of the default SSI&#39;s you set your in-radiant SUN entity type to &quot;default_whatever_you_called_it&quot; (Press N to open entity info when SUN volume is selected).<br />When you make modifications here now, you will see them live update in the editor. &quot;Color&quot; located under the sun tickbox will affect the entire color of the map.<br />Don&#39;t forget to re-render the sun when you do something affecting light.<br /><br />You can also play with Specular Comp which is how much white you see on the reflectance of an object.<br />Penumbra Inches affects map shadows.<br />Dynamic Shadows is where you enable &quot;cloud shadows&quot; to scroll across your map.<br />Ev Comp, Ev Min and Ev Max and Bounce Count all affect how bright and how well the map looks both in and out of a lit-fog.<br />Lastly, you can change the skybox here.<br /><br />Hope this helps.</p>

You can see in my image or you could see it in pretty much any good BO3 maps. Ask some good mappers like Madgaz, Xela, ect... LUT can make a HUGE difference.<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.631.jpg' | relative_url }}"></p>
