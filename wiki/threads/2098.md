<p>Thread By: Megadeth9811<br />So, I &quot;brought back&quot; one of my older map projects so that I could finish and release it, but I&#39;m having an issue with when trying to load ingame. I get the following error: <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/Fznn9gQ.png"><br /> <br />How can I go about resolving this issue? Thanks.</p>
