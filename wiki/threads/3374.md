<p>while i have been working on sam and giant boxing teddy bear boss fight and patching up my other map Azul parish, I have been working on recreating this abandoned house for awhile now <a href="https://freaktography.com/unused-unwanted-million-dollar-mystery-mansion/">Freaktography</a> for custom zombies, a couple hours of work and its coming along. I hope you guys will enjoy it. You know when you go and spend along time on a project its hard to not get inside my head and lose all ability of knowing how someone will react to it when they see it for the first time. Here is a little tease of what to come in the upcoming months :geek: <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.843.jpg' | relative_url }}"><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.844.jpg' | relative_url }}"><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.845.jpg' | relative_url }}"><br />Theres still sooooo much to be done, make sure to keep an eye on my <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198353036610/myworkshopfiles/">steam</a> workshop and be ready to play this once i am finished. :cool:</p>
