<p>Reply By: PentaFrost<br />Hi Nate.<br /><br /><br /><br />So ive seen that when a player picks this up, the hud icon only shows for that player, and not all players. Considering this is a powerup that has an effect valuable for all players, shoulndt the icon show for all players?<br /><br /><br /><br />Just a thought, because sometimes i get confused if my buddy has picked up time warp. I would like to be aware of it.<br /><br /><br /><br />Tell me what you think :)</p>

The powerup is really nice and well done but it kinda bothers me that it doesnt show for all players since it affect all players. I hope there is a way to resolve this :). Also on top of this is there anyway I can play a sound for all players when I pick it up ?</p>

<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br />Before I fix let me ask another question: does the Fast Feet affect only one player as well? or is it also affecting all players but not giving them the hud? My understanding of the powerups script must be wrong</p>

<p>Reply By: MJPW<br />I swear I&#39;ve seen this power up in some maze map like two years ago  anyways I&#39;ve been trying to get it converted over I guess you saved me a bit of time. Would you happen to know what to put in to make the vision B/W during the time its active?</p>
