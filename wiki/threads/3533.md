<p>For some odd reason, my map has these weird red reflections appearing on various surfaces, and since I&#39;m relatively new to mapping, I don&#39;t really have any clue to fix these. These reflections appear both in Radiant and in gameplay, and I&#39;ve tried playing around with both my lighting and reflection probe settings, but none of these settings seem to fix this problem.<br /><br />Here&#39;s how they look in Radiant:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.956.jpg' | relative_url }}"><br /><br />And here&#39;s how they look in-game:<img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.957.jpg' | relative_url }}"><br /><br />If anybody could help me out on this, that would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>ya what rage said.<br />place a reflection probe in the middle of the room from the entity browser and stretch it like a brush to the edges touch the walls. You can also select the probe and (i think) alt+click the walls to make the probe snap to them.<br />Then build lighting again (click lightning bolt) and compile lights in the launcher</p>
