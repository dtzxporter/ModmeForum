<p>Hey so I recently added in Nova crawlers into my map off a old Harry Bo21 file and they work, however I have a issue where they spawn non stop in the round leaving only a few actual zombies per round. Is there any way to delay/limit the spawner? This isn&#39;t urgent but would be a nice quality of life improvement. I&#39;m not sure the on the scripting considering its not a normal zombie spawner but and suggestions would be appreciated. <br /><br />TLDR: Limit spawn point to spawn like 5 to 10 zombie&#39;s per round</p>
