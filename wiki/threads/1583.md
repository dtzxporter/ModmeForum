<p>Thread By: ZombieKid164<br />So I&#39;ve been working on a map for a while, but now whenever I try to run it, the game crashes. Does anyone know a fix?</p>

Remove assets if you recently added them and add +log 2 to allow the log file to save, post your log here.</p>

Secondly, how do I add another log?</p>
