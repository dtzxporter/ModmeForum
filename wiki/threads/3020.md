<p>I&#39;m currently working on a map which could use the wall barricades used in the ZC remastered map Verr&#252;ckt. The thing is I&#39;m not sure how to get them. I have tried using wraith for it but it could not find it. Looked on the internet but could not find any info.<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.452.jpg' | relative_url }}"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.451.jpg' | relative_url }}"></p>

<p>I could be wrong however wouldn&#39;t it be as simple as editing the window prefab then changing the boards to bricks and positioning them right?</p>
