<p>Thread By: myntz<br />As the title states. I was working in radiant, and everything was working fine. went to compile the map and it crashed radiant. It now crashes while &quot;processing xmodel meshes&quot; anytime I try and load my map.<br /><br /><br /><br />I would have thought it would either display an error and not load the model or something. Now I literally cannot access my map. Any ideas anyone?</p>

<p>Reply By: ultraz_viper<br />unfortunately this is an outstanding bug in the beta tools which needs to be addresses.... I Thinks its something to do with a certain model being placed, be sure to constantly back your maps up in development and especially take caution while adding models, lets just hope they release a fix for this.</p>
