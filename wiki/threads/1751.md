<p>Reply By: Erthrock<br />well, making your map harder is just a matter of how its designed, but if you want zombies to always be sprinting even on round one nate smith has made a script for it and there should be a tutorial on it somewhere</p>

<p>Reply By: Exofile<br />A few easy to come up with tips;<br /><br />&lt;ul style=&quot;padding-left:40px;margin:0;&quot;&gt;<br />&lt;li style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;Make your paths/areas narrow, and less open, fill in open spaces with debris and alike.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;Don&#39;t give players any place of safety, have Z&#39; spawn from any side and location. No matter where you&#39;re at, you&#39;ll want to keep checking your back.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;Increase overall price, up the price on doors so players slower get their map fully opened. (Unless done really well, can be considered a bit &quot;lazy&quot;!)&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ul&gt;<br /><br /><br /><br />Hope it helps! <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://aviacreations.com/modme/emoticons/toothlessan.gif"></p>
