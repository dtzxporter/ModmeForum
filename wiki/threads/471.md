<p>Thread By: Runis<br />I have been trying to use the Clip Generation Settings for models around my map and it used to always work great. I reinstalled my mod tools a few weeks ago recently because of some problems but ever since then the generator doesn&#39;t work anymore. Instead of detailed clipping, it just spawns a box. I thought my Detail was turned all the way down but even at 100% still just seems to spawn a box. I checked my Grind Size but that still didn&#39;t work. Anyone know whats going on? If I have some settings checked by accident?</p>
