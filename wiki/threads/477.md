<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />1) On your light make sure the correct lighting states are checked.<br />2) The lights may not be visible because it&#39;s too bright where the light is.</p>

<p>Reply By: Psh<br />Day light maps require much higher &quot;stops&quot; for the lights to be visible, regardless of being in a closed room or out in direct sunlight. A standard light map typically requires like 14.00 stop to be visible at all while a night map sits pretty much at 1.0.</p>
