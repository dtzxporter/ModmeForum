<p>Thread By: MrGuacamole115<br />Hey, pretty new to radiant, have all the basics and necessities sorted. As well as detail .ect.<br /><br />But I was wondering how to get zombies to mantle an object? Much like they do to get over barriers, except without the barrier part.<br /><br />I&#39;ve tried fiddling with the traverse brush, the mantle brush, path nodes. But can&#39;t find it. Anyone on here know who&#39;d be willing to explain? If not then that&#39;s ok ^^</p>
