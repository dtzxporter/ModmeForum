<p>Thread By: ProbablyTrue<br />Hello, I&#39;ve been trying to import models from MWR and Cod Ghosts but everytime I get on APE and try to click on an imported model it shows this error:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/DUt8AyG.png"><br />The problem is, APE is looking for my models and their textures in:<br /> <br /><span style="color:#ff6600;">F:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops III\model_export[COLOR=#ff00ff]modern_warfare_rm</span>\xmodels\btr_hookah_01_purple[/COLOR]<br /> <br />but that directory doesn&#39;t even exist. I don&#39;t have a &quot;<span style="color:#ff00ff;">modern_warfare_rm</span>&quot; folder. It should be looking for them in: <br /> <br /><span style="color:#ff6600;">F:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops III\model_export[COLOR=#00ffff]imported_models</span>\btr_hookah_01_purple[/COLOR]<br /> <br />I know that the <span style="color:#00ffff;">imported_models</span> folder is in the correct place, so how could I make it so APE searches for these models in that folder?</p>
