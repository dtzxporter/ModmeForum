<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br />Sorry for the delayed response. I found out my hotel had a lazy river so what grown man wouldnt want to go in circles for a few hours? lol well here you go: <br /><br /><br /><br />1) Add this too the bottom of your mapname.gsc (assuming you have already added the my powerup to your mapname.gsc)<br /><br /><a href="http://pastebin.com/u2rX7Bwb">Alternative Code Link</a><br /><br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
function main_shootable_perk_slot() { trigs = GetEntArray( "shootale_perk_slot", "targetname" ); level.shot_perk_slots = 0; level.shot_perk_slots_goal = trigs.size; foreach( trig in trigs ) trig thread waittill_shot(); } function waittill_shot() { self waittill( "trigger", player ); level.shot_perk_slots++; player PlayLocalSound( "meteor_affirm" ); // change to any sound you want to play to the player if( level.shot_perk_slots == level.shot_perk_slots_goal ) reward_all_players(); } function reward_all_players() { players = GetPlayers(); foreach( player in players ) nsz_powerup_empty_bottle::grab_bottle( player ); }
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br /><br /><br />Then in your mapname.gsc add this line in your function main: <br /><br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
main_shootable_perk_slot(); 
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br /><br /><br />That should work, but I cant test it as I am away on vacation and on a laptop that cant run Bo3</p>

<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br /><blockquote><em>tbone-5</em>okay i added the trigger with the target name &amp; nothing happeneds when i shoot it</blockquote><br /><br />Try adding this at the bottom of main_shootable_perk_slot: <br /><br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
wait(20); 
iprintlnbold( "There are "+trigs.size+" triggers in the map" ); 
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br /><br /><br />If you dont get that statement within 20 seconds of spawning, then the function either isnt running or you dont have the triggers correctly named</p>
