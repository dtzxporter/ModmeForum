<p>So I&#39;d my map working fine, add some things and the map crash without any errror in the launcher.<br /><br />So took them out and the map still doesn&#39;t load.<br /><br />So I rollback to a version it&#39;s suppose is working but instead of crash and close the game it just stay in a black screen<br /><br />The problem is, the launcher is compiling just fine and it ends with &quot;done&quot; as usual.<br /><br />Anyone know what could it be? I&#39;m like super stress right now and any help, anything, would be really appreciated &#128546;</p>

<p><blockquote>Um, I don&#39;t know what that means &#128532;<br /></blockquote><br />check your code for lines with while(1) {   }. Inside the curly brackets there should be a wait(0.05); or a different number.<br />if you&#39;re unsure post any new code you added here</p>
