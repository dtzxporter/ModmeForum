<p>So my cold war 1911&#39;s sound is working perfectly fine<br />But every weapon ive added after that has had no sound example: (ANY WWII GUNS), (ANY COLD WAR GUNS), (ANY BLACK OPS 1 GUNS)<br />Im sure ive done it all right i did the same thing as i did with the 1911 (which works)<br />Ive added the line of text to user_aliases, zm_levelcommon_weapons (in my zm_&quot;mapname&quot;) and my zone folder<br /><br /><br />Any help would be appreciated :)</p>

<p>check if the sound file is .wav and if the frequence is 48000Hz in audacity like that for each sound <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1259.png' | relative_url }}"></p>
