<p>greetings, i&#39;m fairly new to this site. i don&#39;t know if this is the right place to ask or not, but ive really been needing and would love some help with extracting models/other assets from BO4. i&#39;ve tried to do so in the past but the farthest i&#39;ve gotten is getting ximage files and sound files. I believe i have all the right components, i just need a little bit of guidance. If anyone can please help me out with this that would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!</p>
