<p>Thread By: NINJAMAN829<br />My map is going to have 4 or 5 pistols that are similar to the mr6 and I wanted to see if there was a way each player could individually choose which pistol they wanted to use out of those options to give more freedom to what the wish.<br /> <br />If anybody has any ideas, that be great thanks. :D</p>

<p>Reply By: easyskanka<br />i dont know how you would do it, but could you use <br /> <br />    level.start_weapon = (getWeapon(&quot;your_weapon_name&quot;));<br /> <br />somehow and add your other pistols in as a random chance at spawn? they wouldn&#39;t be able to choose which pistol they want to use but would at least change it up on every game</p>

Not me to decide beforehand what weapon each person gets</p>

Like how the ugx mod does when you choose a gamemode and such, except its for the starting weapon</p>

I can&#39;t help you with that, i don&#39;t know alot about scripting, let alone the UGX game-mode scripting.</p>
