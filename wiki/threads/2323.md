<p>Thread By: Frost Iceforge<br />Revelations inspired trading table. Use the trading table to donate any primary weapon of choice to other players. In solo, you can use it to hold an extra weapon for when you run out of ammo or as a little support for someone who joins mid game.<br />Unlike Revelations, taking a weapon when you have 2 (or 3 with Mule Kick) will put your current weapon up for grabs. On Revelations, it would just delete it. To clear the table completely, someone with 1 gun (or 2 with Mule Kick) will need to use it.<br /><br />V1.3 download:<br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_6Z9l4Ufab_V2xyUE1HWFJzbVU/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-1JOv7ti5za2l9Y9tZyeW0w">Download</a><br />V1.0 Initial release.<br />V1.1 Fixed path of the poster texture.<br />V1.2 Added name of weapon on table to hintstring. Resolved weapon duping bugs involving Mule Kick and having the same weapon as the table.<br />V1.3 Resolved dupe bug that used tacticals such as trip mines and the shield. Now, holding a tactical will prevent you from using trading table.<br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E7ALrCyF1ek" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br />Special thanks to NateSmith, lilrifa, and So00ki Scoba for scripting assistance and tbone-5 for bug testing.</p>

<p>Reply By: tbone-5<br />by the way, your file path for the poster in the GDT is wrong for what you had in the file. anyway though nice job on this script, the only thing i could say to improve is to have the pack a punch weapon camo show on the model on the table like revelations &amp; the trigger hint to have the weapon name of the weapon you are taking. also i am not sure if you meant for this but you can dupe weapons &amp; wonderweapons very easily</p>

I will fix anything that needs fixing. Idk how to get the weapon to show the camo, so I will get the hintstring to be the name of the weapon. Can you tell me how you got to dupe weapons? I am aware that you can put a Thundergun, etc. on the table then hit the box again. I can&#39;t really prevent this without changing the box too, so I won&#39;t fix it. Is there another way to dupe weapons as well?</p>

I can easily make the script not let you pick up the weapon if you have the same weapon already. I already made the script not let you place down a Death Machine, so I can just copy and paste that if statement and change minigun to be the name of the table weapon. As far as any Mule Kick bugs, I did not actually test that perk when making this, so I will do some testing myself to see what&#39;s up. Thanks for telling me all this. Hopefully I can get it patched before all the box maps from now on are dupe fests!</p>

<p>Reply By: Frost Iceforge<br />So I just tested Mule Kick. Using some debugging, I found out the function to test if you have max primary weapons doesn&#39;t consider if you have Mule Kick. It&#39;s just like &quot;That player has 2 guns... CLOSE ENOUGH! What is Mule Kick? Never heard of it!&quot; I thought based on its name it would also look at your weapon slots...<br />Good news though, I got the table to not let you pick up a gun you have. That dupe glitch is fixed. Just need to find a way to detect Mule Kick.</p>

Hopefully there aren&#39;t any more dupe glitches...</blockquote><br /> after testing a few things there seems to be no more huge dupe issues so good job, now if you can just figure out how treyarch did the camos on the weapons on the table that would be a bonus at this point it seems to be working well now. i did find something while just looking though the scripts to see how they set the camo on the models idk if this will help but in zm_utility i found a lot of the weapon model stuff &amp; this<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
function spawn_buildkit_weapon_model( player, weapon, camo, origin, angles )
{
	weapon_model = spawn( "script_model", origin ); 
	if ( isdefined( angles ) )
	{
		weapon_model.angles = angles;
	}

	upgraded = zm_weapons::is_weapon_upgraded( weapon );
	if ( upgraded &amp;&amp; (!IsDefined( camo ) || 0 &gt; camo) )
	{
		camo = zm_weapons::get_pack_a_punch_camo_index( undefined );
	}

	weapon_model UseBuildKitWeaponModel( player, weapon, camo, upgraded );

	return weapon_model;

To clear the table completely, someone with 1 gun (or 2 with Mule Kick) will need to use it.   V1.3 download:   V1.0 Initial release. V1.1 Fixed path of the poster texture. V1.2 Added name of weapon on table to hintstring. Resolved weapon duping bugs involving Mule Kick and having the same weapon as the table. V1.3 Resolved dupe bug that used tacticals such as trip mines and the shield. Now, holding a tactical will prevent you from using trading table.    Special thanks to NateSmith, lilrifa, and So00ki Scoba for scripting assistance and tbone-5 for bug testing.  I need Help My texture is not charged :/</blockquote><br /> Do you mean the texture for the poster? What do you mean it&#39;s not charged? Screenshots?</p>

<p>Reply By: sharpgamers4you<br /><blockquote><em>tbone-5</em><br />by the way, your file path for the poster in the GDT is wrong for what you had in the file. anyway though nice job on this script, the only thing i could say to improve is to have the pack a punch weapon camo show on the model on the table like revelations &amp; the trigger hint to have the weapon name of the weapon you are taking. also i am not sure if you meant for this but you can dupe weapons &amp; wonderweapons very easily</blockquote><br /> hey i have a quick question, i followed the steps in the download file (the text file) and i get a error. this is the error it gives me on launcher.<br />^1function<br />^1-------^<br />^1ERR(0) scripts/zm/zm_MYMAPNAME.gsc (474,8) in &quot;stockweapons_displayname_correction()&quot; : syntax error, unexpected TOKEN_FUNCTION : function<br /> <br />So what i tried to do is fix it, but idk how to.... like it says something about the stockweapons_displayname_correction but idk what i should do., did i pasted the scripts in the wrong file or?...<br /> <br />anyway great job and if you know a fix plz i could take any tips :)<br /> <br />P.S. Love your work!</p>

<p>can someone confirm - if i intend to use this with custom weapons (skye&#39;s MW pack) and none of the stock weapons, do i need to add/remove the weapons in the GSC?<br />does the stock weapons script become irrelevant? Does it need to remain in there or remove it etc<br /><br />E.g<br /><br />function stockweapons_displayname_correction(weapon_name)<br />{<br /><br />    switch(weapon_name)<br />    {<br />        case &quot;WEAPON_THUNDERGUN&quot;: weapon_name = &quot;Thundergun&quot;;<br />                break;<br />        case &quot;ZOMBIE_THUNDERGUN_UPGRADED&quot;: weapon_name = &quot;Zeus Cannon&quot;;<br />            break;</p>
