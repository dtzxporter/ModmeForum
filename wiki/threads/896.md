<p>Thread By: CT8918<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Does anyone know of a script that would allow your guy to continue to move/slide while on ice? A portion of my map is ice so I would like to have this to make the area harder. I tried using a slick, which worked, but the animation of sliding caused the player&#39;s character to become malformed. </p></p>
