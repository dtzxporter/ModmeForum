<p>Thread By: gotopiz<br />Hey you guys,<br /> <br />So I had a fully functioning map, up until I tried to install harry&#39;s shrieker zombies. Now everytime I compile I get this error<br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a/HCkByaG" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /> <br />Even with the code removed from my gsc,csc, and zone files; The error still persists. Any help would be appreciated<br /> <br />For further context,  i have harrys napalm and weapon pack installed, and both worked perfectly fine prior to introducing the shrieker</p>

<p>Reply By: MyNameIsNobody<br />My guess is either you didnt copy the xanim_export file to your root, or you didnt transfer the folders in &quot;YOUR MAP NAME&quot; to your maps folder. OR maybe you messed up on step 6 with the kvps? since it seems related to the animations though, i&#39;d guess something didnt get copied to the right location, or a character is missing in your gsc/csc/zone(s) etc.</p>
