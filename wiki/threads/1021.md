<p>Thread By: Ahmed02354<br />Why is it that when I run my map, in some places my FPS drops drastically to 30-50, and whenever im passed that area it turns back to 60...</p>

<p>Reply By: Exofile<br />Black Ops III automatically portals map for you. When you can&#39;t see something, the engine does it&#39;s best at making it not render. Therefore your FPS will go up with less to render. When you&#39;re in the Area, I suspect it&#39;s rendering so much that it takes more processing. Either get a better computer- or change the area to be less intensive.<br /> <br />I could be wrong though.</p>

I hope there is an actual fix</p>

The engine will portal for you, but it&#39;s not flawless.</p>

Do you mean through &#39;&#39;Nvidia GeForce Experience&#39;&#39;?<br />or through settings in black ops itself?</p>

Changing graphical settings in Black Ops III will also decrease the stress caused, but you should always aim to optimize your map as much as you can.</p>
