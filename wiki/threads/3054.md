<p>Aight so someone on discord asked if it was possible to have another model_export folder since his/her disk was full. Kinda yes.<br />Basically you just move the folder to another disk and tell Windows that that folder is in BO3/root. This works with any folder/file anywhere on your PC but for the sake of this tutorial imma just stick to model_export.<br /><br />Step 1: Turn off Steam cuz you don&#39;t want it to start redownloading everything.<br />Step 2: Move the model_export folder to another disk.<br />Step 3: Open CMD in admin and type the following<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
mklink /D "E:\Path\model_export" "D:\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops III\model_export"
E being the new disk and D the old

{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
You can do the same for a specific file by just adding the filename at the end.<br /><br />This is useful if you want for example a battle royale map  on a SSD but you don&#39;t want to fill it with the rest of the game<br /><br /><br />Source:<br /><a href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/create-symbolic-links-windows10/">https://www.maketecheasier.com/create-symbolic-links-windows10/</a></p>
