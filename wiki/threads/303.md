<p>Thread By: ItalianMilkMan<br />So ive just made a super detailed bridge that has lots of bits and pieces everywhere, and I&#39;ve just realized that I need to rotate it the tiniest bit. To manually select every single piece of detail that I&#39;ve put in is almost impossible.<br /><br /><br /><br />So I was wondering if there&#39;s like a way to highlight a certain part of the map and have it selected. I know that if you press &#39;I&#39;, it will select everything in the map, but that wont work in my situation because there would be a ton of stuff that I would then need to deselect.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks everyone!</p>

<p>Reply By: Exofile<br />Hello! You can create a single brush, make it cover what you want and right click, select, select touching/inside or whichever you need. This way it&#39;ll remove the brush you made, but everything that is inside or touching depending on what you chose will be now <em>selected</em>. Hope this helps!</p>
