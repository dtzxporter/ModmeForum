<p>Thread By: Jdcobra<br />How exactly would this work? I&#39;m trying to port the Titus-6 and I can&#39;t get the explosions to work.</p>

<p>Reply By: Dick_Nixon<br />I would assume the problem you&#39;re facing is in the weapon file you&#39;ve created. If you&#39;ve based it off a bulletweapon asset file, that&#39;s your problem. The correct file to use is (I believe it is called) projectileweapon. If you have based it on a projectileweapon, then maybe FX or sounds may not be working.</p>
