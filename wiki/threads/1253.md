<p>Reply By: Scobalula<br />The &quot;weapon_name&quot; is the literal name of the weapon minus _zm. If you downloaded this weapon and someone asked you to add to your zone:<br /> <br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
// Weapon with _zm at the end, in zone, it needs the absolute name.
weapon,sp00ki_scary_weapons_zm
weapon,sp00ki_scary_weapons_upgraded_zm

// Weapon without _zm at the end.
weapon,psh_weapon
weapon,psh_weapon_upgraded
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />And with those added, an example of the resulting gamedata entries would be:<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
// Our weapon that had _zm at the end, in ZM besides Zone, we ommit _zm.
sp00ki_scary_weapons,sp00ki_scary_weapons_upgraded,,5000,lmg,,0,,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,0,,FALSE,FALSE,lmg,FALSE,FALSE,

// Our weapon that had  didn&#39;t have _zm at the end,
psh_weapon,psh_weapon_upgraded,,5000,lmg,,0,,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,0,,FALSE,FALSE,lmg,FALSE,FALSE,
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />You can find the weapon&#39;s name in APE as well, as that&#39;s the name you use for the zone file.</p>
