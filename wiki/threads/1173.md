<p>Thread By: franebk<br />I don t have any knowledge about scripting so I wondered if someone could help me with a lava/fire script. I want that zombies step in into the fire and they caught on fire (like when the kboom is activated), when they die it makes the explosion effect of the hellhound. They are in fire for a certain amount of time, then they went back to normal zombies.</p>
