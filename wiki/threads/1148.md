<p>Thread By: belly3031<br />The Origins tank drives perfectly fine on my map until the player stands on top of the tank. The tank goes crazy and even sometimes fly&#39;s up into the air so I was wondering if anyone knows how to stop this.<br />I want the tank to not be influenced by a player and just keep its steady driving no matter what.<br /> <br />Thanks guys :)</p>
