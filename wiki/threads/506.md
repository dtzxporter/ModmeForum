<p>Thread By: Zixology<br />Literally all I did was replace a texture and now I cannot fully compile my map because I get the &quot;NavVolume generation is skipped.&quot; Warning.<br />I changed absolutely nothing else and my map was working perfectly fine up until then. I even tried reverting the texture back and the warning still remained.<br />I&#39;d really like to know if my entire map is now completely gone since there&#39;s nothing I can add at this point.</p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />Skipping navVolume generation is not exactly a problem in my experience but if it is for you, go to <span style="color:#00ff00;">bo3/radiant/autosave_backup</span> and find a previous copy of your map and move it to <span style="color:#00ff00;">bo3/map_source/zm</span> and rename it (remove the date/time)</p>

No ai will fucking move lmao</p>

I&#39;ve replaced textures before and this hasn&#39;t happened.<br />Also, I have added a new NavMesh into the map and covered the area, however I do not know the specific targetname needed as well as any necessary kvps.</p>

I just changed a custom texture for a poster. That&#39;s it.<br />Since I&#39;ve dragged a new NavMesh and covered the map with it, I now get an error since it doesn&#39;t have a targetname.</p>

<p>Reply By: Zixology<br /><blockquote><em>Harry Bo21</em><br />weird   thought it was a navvolume not a trigger anyway</blockquote><br /> It technically is a volume. That&#39;s why I&#39;m confused as well.<br />And I cannot use an autosaved archive of the map because the most recent autosave was done 3 months ago. Too much has changed since then.</p>

<p>Reply By: Zixology<br /><blockquote><em>Harry Bo21</em><br />weird   thought it was a navvolume not a trigger anyway</blockquote><br /> I applied the target name of a zone to the NavVolume and now the compilation says that there&#39;s no NavVolume at all. Did the recent mod tools update do something that I&#39;m not aware of or something?</p>
