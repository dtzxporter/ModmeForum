<p>Hi<br />I have this big weird problem, when I play in splitscreen the game crash after shooting a gun<br /><br />This is weird because only happen with certain guns, like the ICR from BO3 (not ported) and some ported guns like the Kar98k<br /><br />When I play solo it works fine and I&#39;m not able to test in coop (different PCs)<br /><br />I try different things like:<br />- Play from the launcher and the game itself<br />- Different maps<br />- I compile the maps before and after verify the game cache<br /><br />So yeah, I don&#39;t know what could be<br />Any help would be really apreciated :(</p>

<p>If i&#39;m not mistaken, it&#39;s due to using a muzzleflash for thirdperson that&#39;s invalid/not working. I had this issue a while ago with some of the rifle/LMG muzzleflashes, and it started to work again when I swapped them for something else.</p>

<p><blockquote>:scream: ok, I&#39;m gonna try that, thanks!<br />But just wondering, how can I do that? :LOL:<br /></blockquote><br />well, if it&#39;s a custom gun, just change what muzzleflash it&#39;s using in APE, should work after that.</p>
