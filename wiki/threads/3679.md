<br /><br />yeah there is some errors other than the max_map_nodes one, but i can perfectly compile &amp; play with them.<br /><br />i googled the error, and peoples had the same on world at war, the solution was to select most of the map and click make detail (all my out of map is already non-colliding)<br /><br />i saved, and tried to compile, same error.<br /><br />so i selected everything BUT the floor, and..... nothing.<br /><br />do you guys have any solution ?  ive put around 300hours on this and i don&#39;t want to lose all what i did :/<br />ive seen MASSIVE maps on WIP discords and they never had this kind of problem :/<br /><br /><br />some pics:

<p><blockquote>I would try fixing the errors in log file first just for the heck of it and see what happens...<br /></blockquote><br />as said above, before i got this error I could compile the map without worry and play it, these errors are not the problem.<br /><br />also, I had this error before on an old map that had no other error in the log file.</p>

<p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops III\radiant\autosave_backup<br /><br />copy and paste your map into your map_source folder, open radiant open the prefab save, link compile and see if the error happens again. if it does find a older auto save of your map and repeat.</p>

<p><blockquote>i mean i fixed litterally every errors but the max_map_node still here, and now i don&#39;t have any map backup for some reason<br /></blockquote><br />I know this is a dumb question since you did see the people in waw having the issue, Did you select every brush including broken floor and wall sections?<br />When you do broken floors/walls, if you don&#39;t make every piece detail instead of structural, you get that error pretty easy in waw(I know you are in bo3). I remember hitting that limit just remaking verruckt, just because I wasn&#39;t making floor/wall breaks detail brushes.<br /><br />The reason I ask is because in your &quot;structural only&quot; image there appears to be holes made from brushes, but I could be looking at it wrong. Also even though your out of map brushes are non-colliding, did you try making them detail anyway?</p>
