I honestly don&#39;t know where that error ever came from, and I had to delete and reinstall mod tools to get rid of it.</p>

Perhaps you installed wrong?</p>

I have no idea where that error comes from, and there&#39;s not enough evidence to make me think Snail&#39;s Pace causes it somehow. You may just have to do what I did and reinstall mod tools.</p>
