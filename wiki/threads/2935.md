<p>Today I&#39;m going to show you how to add high-quality shaders to Wardogs perks because the ones that come with the pack don&#39;t look as good as the originals. As seen below...<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.356.png' | relative_url }}"><br />Also, there&#39;s a bug where you have your perks overlapping with your powerups as seen above and I will show you how to fix that as well<br />You&#39;re going to need to download your favorite perk shaders. <br />Here are the ones I&#39;m using-<br /><a href="https://forum.modme.co/threads/perks-shaders-in-bo3-style-and-more.2836/">https://forum.modme.co/threads/perks-shaders-in-bo3-style-and-more.2836/</a><br />If you want tombstone, get it from here and add it the same way-<br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KdRPx8K-Mvwe6B0qkmd9xiQYzS9oHUR5/view">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KdRPx8K-Mvwe6B0qkmd9xiQYzS9oHUR5/view</a><br /><br />you need to then go into Your Bo3 root folder\texture_assets\wardog\t7\perk<br />it will bring you to a screen like this-<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.357.png' | relative_url }}"><br />You&#39;re then going to want to copy all your shaders into this folder and delete the ones you don&#39;t need like custom/madgaz/bo4 so, it looks like this-<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.358.png' | relative_url }}"><br />select view in your file explorer and make sure file name extensions is checked<img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.359.png' | relative_url }}"><br />Take these names and paste them to the new shader(delete the original shaders first)<br />wardog_t7_hud_perk_phd.tif<br />wardog_t7_hud_perk_whos.tif<br />wardog_t7_hud_perk_vulture.tif<br />wardog_t7_hud_perk_tombstone.tif<br /><br />It should look like this-<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.360.png' | relative_url }}"><br />That&#39;s it for the shaders!  Compile, link and light your map and when you run it it will look more like this-<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.361.png' | relative_url }}"><br />(you can do this with any future shades as long as your rename everything)<br /><br />Now on to the fix for the overlapping perks and powerups<br /><br />Simply go into your Bo3 root folderI\share\raw\scripts\wardog\perk and open up _wardog_perk_hud.gsc<br />on line 90 it says<br />hud.x = 76 + (entity.perk_hud.size * 30);<br />change this to <br />hud.x = 76 + (entity.perk_hud.size * 27<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.362.png' | relative_url }}"><br />save, compile, link and light and when you run your map the perks won&#39;t overlap with your powerups<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.363.png' | relative_url }}"></p>
