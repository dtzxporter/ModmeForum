<p>Thread By: TheMikeyMan<br />I want to get some models from dead of the night for a cemetery portion in my map. I&#39;m not sure if wraith rips assets from bo4. Anyone know how to rip models from bo4?</p>

<p>Reply By: Wild<br />Wraith won&#39;t because it&#39;s no longer supported. You have to use <a href="https://github.com/Scobalula/Greyhound/releases">Greyhound</a> by Scobalula. Also, for BO4 you need to use <a href="https://github.com/Scobalula/T8ZoneRipper/releases">this</a> or else you won&#39;t be able to extract everything.</p>
