<p>Thread By: Stonermagoo420<br />i have been doing this map for a very long time now (had no problems in the past but now my map wont load in) launcher says theres no errors... radiant errors none and gsc is in good condition. I can compile light and link my map no problem but when i go to run it from launcher(or from in game) it dosnt seem to load and just exits out to my desktop.. any help or any way to fix this would be appreciated thx</p>
