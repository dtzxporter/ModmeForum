<p>I haven&#39;t seen this anywhere, I know theres a perk light fix but what about pack a punch? when I turn on power it still looks like its off because of the lighting</p>

<p>Stamp the PaP prefab and look at each individual light. The defaults for PaP lights have very low stops. You will likely have to raise them a bit depending on the lighting around your PaP machine.</p>
