<p>Every time I try and play split-screen on one of my custom maps my fps goes from ~144fps to less than 1fps and of course that is unplayable. Everything runs smoothly on solo on this map, and on split-screen on any other map including all my other custom maps. Has anyone else run into this and know how to fix or what could be the problem? I&#39;ve searched google and the forums here but haven&#39;t found anyone else with the same issue so far...<br /><br />EDIT: Map worked fine on split-screen just a couple weeks ago...I haven&#39;t changed anything script-wise all I&#39;ve done that I can recall is edit the map in radiant. Something else I noticed around the same time was that in radiant models/textures would go invisible at a distance unless I&#39;m viewing it in &quot;game mode&quot; but I don&#39;t see how any of that would cause fps on split-screen to drop to essentially zero.<br /><br />UPDATE: Map plays ok-ish on split-screen if I set my max fps to 50 or less....again this makes no sense as <span style="text-decoration: underline">all my other maps, all treyarch maps, and all custom maps from steam</span> I can play @ ~144fps on split-screen with no hiccups. <br /><br />pc specs: (ACER PREDATOR HELIOS 300)<br />GeForce GTX 1060 6gb Video Card<br />I7-8750H CPU @ 2.20GHz<br />16gb Ram<br />All drivers up to date<br /><br />If anyone has any ideas on what I could do to fix this plz reply.</p>
