<p>Is there a way to change these icons to something else? I&#39;ve changed the character models to my own models but not sure about how to go about changing the icons on the left, help is very much appreciated</p>

<p>Using Wraith/Greyhound, select the &#39;Loaded XImages&#39; setting with the map loaded and use that to find the names of the images you wish to replace, when you find them, the new image assets in APE must be image 2d.</p>

I&#39;ve made the new assets in ape as you&#39;ve said as a image 2d, with the exact same names as the ones I extracted from wraith but everytime I recompile and link, they still stay as default. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m doing something wrong but I&#39;m not sure what</p>

Without adding it there it won&#39;t override with your custom images and will just use the default ones. Open up your map&#39;s zone file by right clicking the map inside of the mod tools launcher and selecting &quot;Edit Zone File&quot;. Then somewhere near the bottom of your zone add this:<br /><br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
//Custom Player Icons
image,name_1
image,name_2
image,name_3
image,name_4

{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br />I don&#39;t know the name of the images so that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t name them, but just replace &quot;name_1, name_2, name_3, and name_4&quot; with the 4 image names. Then link your map and try again ;)</p>

image,uie_t7_zm_hud_score_char1

</blockquote><br /><br />Would you mind posting a screenshot of one of the images in APE? I just wanna make sure the settings/names are how they should be. If it looks fine I&#39;ll play around with changing them myself and see if I can figure it out for you.</p>

<p>Another thing to add is that it seems to try to load the image but doesnt really do it, the 8 x 8 images are just blank pictures so not sure whats happening there<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.12.jpg' | relative_url }}"></p>
