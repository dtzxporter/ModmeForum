<p>Thread By: Long Cut<br />Hey! So as the topic title suggests, I am porting over some foliage from MWR to add into my BO3 root for more choices of plants. My question is: is there anything special I have to do to make the plants sway with the direction of the weather like some of the BO3 plants? I don&#39;t see any sort of foliage animations when searching for foliage in Wraith so I don&#39;t quite know what to think yet lol. Eventually I would like to release a MWR foliage pack to the community so others besides myself can also use these classic plants in their maps. If anyone knows anything about this, please let me know!! The community has been helping me along the way and I would like to give back in any way I can :D<br />Thanks!!</p>
