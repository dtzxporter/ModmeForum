<p>Thread By: Yen466<br />I don&#39;t know exactly what this is, but I imagine it as a 115 ore of some sorts. I took this image out of the preview of the Old London custom map that SirJammy is in the process of making, so please let me know if any of you have any ideas, thanks! <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://s17.postimg.org/5wiap2b1b/115_rock.png"> Also, if you want to check the source video, here it is <iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KeIz8xpUD3s" frameborder="0"></iframe> and the rock appears at about 0:42.</p>

<p>Reply By: Yen466<br />I realized that I was not clear, I wanted to know if anyone knew how to make it or if that was an asset in the game somewhere, thanks!</p>

You&#39;ll either want to make your own, or export -&gt; import it from a different game, i.e; Call of Duty Black Ops II.</p>

<p>Reply By: myntz<br />You could export model and textures from DE/ZNS/GK, set them up in APE (really easy) and use in your map. Not sure if that&#39;s an emissive texture, but you&#39;d have to set up some lights to get the glow looking right.</p>
