<p>Thread By: Matarra<br />Hey guys, this is a script i wasn&#39;t so sure if i wanted to release but here it is. It&#39;s a shared inventory for all players and has a limitation of 20 items at one time due to hud elem limits. I&#39;m not really gonna go into too much detail on how to set it up as its fairly straightforward and i kinda just wanted to release it. Here&#39;s a vid of it<br /> <br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y4VCodTB59Q" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /> <br />Kingdom Hearts menu sounds are obviously optional<br /><a href="https://mega.nz/#!14sXjRLS!RfvVWPuL8QWIVRMdzH9qofLxUIl_PugwpH5UVVrLq28">Download</a></p>

I have been messing around in unity a bit tho</p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />Thank you so much for this! I&#39;ve never been good at HUD scripting and I feel this could really help me get better at it. Thanks for releasing your script.</p>
