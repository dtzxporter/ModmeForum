<p>Thread By: AAAA<br />I&#39;ve set up a custom zm_levelcommon_weapons.csv which seems to work fine, as the guns I added to it appear as they should. However, I set the parameter for showing up in the box of many BO3 guns to &quot;FALSE&quot; yet they still appear alongside my custom weapons, how can i fix this?</p>
