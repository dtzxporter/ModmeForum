<p>Thread By: Christians_Gaming<br />So my lights from the sun, goes through the walls. I&#39;ve tried to make a lightning probe, but didn&#39;t succeed. Any help?</p>

<p>Reply By: Wild<br />Make sure there are no gaps (even if looks like there aren&#39;t any), properly set up probes and you can also put a brush with the caulk_shadow texture behind the wall that light goes through. Those are some quick fixes.</p>
