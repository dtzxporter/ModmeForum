<p>Thread By: Kingslayer Kyle<br />So finally decided to stop being lazy and release a tutorial on how I got my Dark Matter and Alchemical etc with mods enabled.. (I no longer have the offsets for the gumballs so you&#39;ll have to work them out for yourselves.)<br /> <br />You can use ANY camo in the game on your custom classes, be it Dark Matter, Revelations PAP camo, Black Market camos, yeah you get it.. Any.<br /> <br />So first things first, your gonna want your &quot;loadouts_zm_offline_0.cgp&quot; file. (I&#39;ll include a download to mine, just as a sort of baseline to go off if you want to follow this tutorial exactly, for whatever reason that may be.)<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i66.tinypic.com/jsd7nq.png"><br /> <br />Once you&#39;ve got your file, pull up a camo table (I&#39;ll put one in a spoiler underneath this. I&#39;m aware that there are other camos. I just can&#39;t be bothered finding them all individually and I&#39;m quite busy. Hence why I copy n pasted this one)<br /> <br /><br />

<br /><br /> <br /> <br />Now, your gonna want to find the camo that you currently have set on your classes (The one that I currently have set is the Revelations PAP camo.)<br /> <br />So the code for that one is: 121<br /> <br />Now, we&#39;re gonna pull up a Decimal to Hexadecimal converter.. and convert 121 to hex, which would be: 79<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i66.tinypic.com/2uxyahj.jpg"><br /> <br />Now, we&#39;re gonna open up the &quot;loadouts_zm_offline_0.cgp&quot; in a Hex editor, I use HxD (It&#39;s free and lightweight. And pretty much one of the best ones to use for that reason.)<br />Link to the Hex Editor I Use --&gt; <a href="https://mh-nexus.de/en/downloads.php?product=HxD">Download HxD</a><br /> <br />Now press CTRL+F and search for the number you converted, in my case: &quot;79&quot; (Make sure you&#39;re searching for Hex-values under data type)<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i67.tinypic.com/2w4mr6s.png"><br /> <br />What you&#39;ve just found is the camo that you currently have set. (This is just for one weapon btw.)<br /> <br />To change this to a different camo. Get a camos number from the table and convert it to Hexadecimal. (As an example, If we wanted Dark Matter.. the code would be 17, Converted to Hex would be: 11)<br /> <br />If you wanna replace the camo for all weapons (Assuming all weapons have the same camos set) just do CTRL+R, set the data type to Hex-values.. Put the camo code you currently have in the top box and the one you want in the replace box (In hex.. and once again select the data type as Hex-values)<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i67.tinypic.com/vpjkwo.png"><br /> <br />Do File&gt;Save and your good to go, replace the file over your current one.<br /> <br />Tip: The file &quot;loadouts_zm_offline_0.cgp&quot; is located inside your mods folder. (Your mods folder is located in the &quot;players&gt;mods&quot; folder, and the &quot;players&gt;311210&quot; folder. Each mod has it&#39;s own specific class loadout, So if you wanna use this for every mod you have, you&#39;ll have to individually replace each file in each mods folder.)<br /> <br />Hope this was clear and made sense, A lot of people have asked me how I did it and I&#39;ve postponed it for quite a while due to being really busy. Lol.<br /> <br />I would create a program that would automatically do this for you but I just don&#39;t have the time at the moment, Especially with working out all of the offsets lol.. So manually will have to do for now (Unless one of you wants to do it)<br /> <br />This can also be done for MP and I&#39;m assuming campaign wouldn&#39;t be any different either.<br /> <br />Thanks,<br /> <br /><a href="https://mega.nz/#!Xl5TEIia!vUROGQ38VCkjLq231pZQKHm5dk-e8yp-rbymVxZ4h0E">Download</a> <br />Full credit goes to me for the tutorial: Kingslayer Kyle.</p>
