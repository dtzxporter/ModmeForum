(scripting, modeling, designing, etc...) to play my map with me and give me his own opinions for my map as a beginner in terms of how does it look or how is the detailing and all sort of that stuff, so if anyone interested in joining me and testing my map and give his opinions i will be more than happy<br /><br />Steam: Reaper_9382<br /><br />Thanks,</p>
