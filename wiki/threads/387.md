<p>Thread By: Sylvacre<br />Recently my mod tools got messed up from moving hard drives and have been unable to finish my map. If anyone would be interested in helping me, the mapping is practically done I just need all the zoning, doors, and wallbuys. The map is a Black ops 3 remake of Summoner&#39;s Rift from League of Legends. If anyone is willing to help me out I would be willing to compensate them for their work. Thanks in advance.</p>
