<p>Thread By: mathfag<br /><span style="color:#00ff00;">FIXED</span><br /> <br /> <br />For some unknown reason, I can&#39;t see anything in my map except the HUD. Even if i noclip outside of the sun volume where everything should be white.<br />When the screen should turn from black to seeing the map it turns from black to a slightly brighter black.<br />I can still move, kill and interact normally.<br /> <br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/WOjfwOU.png"><br /> <br /> <br /> <br />&lt;hr&gt;At some point and time I accidentally deleted a LUT file that I was using on this map and when I re-rendered the lights everything went black.<br />To fix this i put on the default LUT (&quot;luts_t7_default&quot;) and re-rendered the lights.<br /> <br />Special thanks to Madgaz</p>
