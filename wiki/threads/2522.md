<p>Thread By: Gh0stly<br />I don&#39;t know any type of Script that Would make a Friendly AI immune to damage. I want it to be like it is for Reznov and Polonski for example in campaign how they take no damage. If anyone knows the script for this please let me know as i can&#39;t find anything for it!</p>
