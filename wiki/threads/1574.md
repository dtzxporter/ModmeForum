<p>Thread By: ItalianMilkMan<br /><span style="color:#ffffff;">when my character reloads in black ops 3, the magazine in my gun does not move at all. How do I make it so the character actually moves the magazine? Also same thing with the rail on the side of the gun.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://phabricator.aviacreations.com/w/black_ops_3/guides/weapon_porting/">http://phabricator.aviacreations.com/w/black_ops_3/guides/weapon_porting/</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="color:#ffffff;">Following the tutorial from the link above, I just re-did all of the following steps (from the linked tutorial)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#ffffff;">Preparing the models</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#ffffff;">Exporting the model</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#ffffff;">Compiling the model in APE</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#ffffff;">Converting animations from older games (I only re-did the reload animations)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#ffffff;">Compiling the animations in APE.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="color:#ffffff;">In these steps I also binded the mag and set everything up properly, but I still get the same issue. My character does not move the magazine in my M14 when reloading.</span></p>

<p>Reply By: DTZxPorter<br />Ahh, this is a separate issue, unrealated to the anim import. This could be due to several things such as your export tag names, can you provide the top part (bones) of your xmodel export? also the top part of one of the xanims.</p>

<p>Reply By: DTZxPorter<br />Actually looks like the anim exports are messed up, the clip tag is only being called &quot;clip&quot; in your export, it&#39;s supposed to be tag_clip. Not sure why it&#39;s breaking on export. Might be like that in scene when exporting, double check, thats why it&#39;s not moving though.</p>
