<p>Thread By: MJPW<br />So I&#39;ve been having this issue with my Slasher boss where his saw isn&#39;t fully aligned with his hands. The best result I&#39;ve gotten is from adding it as a submodel to the Slasher&#39;s body and changing the position to match it the way I need it to. It all looks great in APE but when I get into the game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0-ysHnpiAk">he isn&#39;t holding the saw until he is killed</a>. I&#39;ve tried various solutions but none have the tweaking option so I figured I&#39;d reach out to see if someone may know a solution. Thank you in advance :)</p>
