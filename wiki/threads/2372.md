<p>Thread By: Symbo<br />Hey everyone!<br /> <br />I worked on the zns jumpscare for a few days to take a break with mapping. <br />It only works with Dempsey, Nikola&#239;, Richtofen and Takeo characters. It spawns only once per game and unlike the original also work on solo. You re free to modify the script as you like of course.<br /> <br />The way it&#39;s triggered depends on you as the way it works on Zetsubou is to me too complicated for a custom map. You can set many spawns locations or only one, it&#39;s on you.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Here is the link with a readme text file wich explains how to install it: <br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1odlRaMSz1wLpmrNVgKZTS6GGhrX9hpAd/view?usp=sharing">Download</a> <br />And a short video to show how it looks like:<br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JOVhiTe0Exs" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /> <br />This is nothing revolutionary, but I expect a credit if you re using it :)<br /> <br />Hope you enjoy and have a good time modding/mapping !<br /> <br /> <br />Edit: I tested it multiple times and some friends did too, everything worked fine, but someone just report me his game crash when the second animation should play. Any scripter ready to help me solve that issue is welcome to DM me. :(</p>
