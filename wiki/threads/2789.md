<p>Basically I&#39;ve been getting this error and I have no idea what&#39;s causing it.<br />This occurs whenever I try to light my map, (pressing the lightning bolt).<br />Also i have tried deleting all of the probes on the map and I still get the exact same ERROR. :mad:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.211.png' | relative_url }}"><br />If anyone could help me out I&#39;d very much appreciate it as I&#39;ve worked quite hard on this map/ Thanks!</p>

<p>I don&#39;t remember if was the same problem, but I get something similar multiple times.<br />But I know it is because my video card only have 4GB and Radiant need a lot more to handle and compile the map.<br /><br />The way I did to solve it is making my map in like multiple prefabs, then remove some of them and then hit the light bottom. After this, I add again all the prefabs I remove and just exit Radiant without hit the light bottom again, and then just compile from the launcher as usual<br />This in order to have a lot less stuff in my map so my video card can handle it.<br /><br />Hope this solve your problem</p>

Make sure all games and applications are closed before you compile.</p>

<p>Pretty sure this is how Treyarch makes their maps anyways</p>
