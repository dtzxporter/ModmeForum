<p>Thread By: ZombieKid164<br />Hello there! I am making an island map and I need to put in a dense fog around the Island so the player cannot see forever. Would you do this with litfog or worldfog and what would you do to make it more dense than the default fog? Thanks, any help is greatly appreciated! <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://aviacreations.com/modme/emoticons/smile.png"></p>

<p>Reply By: Wild<br />You would use world_fog. lit_fog is only for volumetric lighting and you won&#39;t see any of it really without a light. world_fog is used for normal fog. I haven&#39;t played with the setting on world_fog to help you set it up but that&#39;s what you use.</p>

I figured out you can edit the density of the fog in the Asset Editor.</p>
