<p>Thread By: mapmaker12<br />Hello!<br />I was wondering if someone could help me with a script for constant round change, like on a timer. I would like it to be <strong>exactly</strong> like in Octogonal Ascension. I believe it is called &#39;timed gameplay&#39;. The time between rounds gets longer and longer(as the rounds go on). It needs to be<strong>exactly</strong> like Octogonal Ascension. Thanks for all of your help. I will credit anyone that helps. Also, if you could make a script to make the zombies to run faster. Hope this is not too much to ask. Thanks. :)</p>

 <br /> <br />this code will advance to whatever round you like, however<br /><br />a - the round you skip to - is the round &quot;1 under&quot; the passed result, eg pass 22 as &quot;n_round&quot; will skip you to round 21<br /><br />b - doesnt seem to handle updating the zombies run speed, simple fix to that tho, just pointing out it doesnt natively do it</p>

I probably should have reworded it. I have almost no experience in scripting and was hoping someone could make a script for me that switches the rounds automatically, like on a timer. For example the first round will be 7 seconds, round 2 is 10, round 3 is 14, round 4 is 17, ... round 12 is 40 seconds ect. I am making a challenge map that the zombies spawn exactly like in the Octogonal Ascension map (BO3). Thanks for your help. <br /> <br />PS. I have finished the zombie speed script, so no more need for that. Thanks. :)</p>
