<p>Thread By: dimakristally<br />I have a trigger in my map with a custom KVP called &#39;teleport_cost&#39;.  How can I get the value of this KVP via GSC?  I have tried the following and it has not worked, I was specifically told that the cost was undefined. <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
trigger = GetEnt("teleport_trigger", "targetname");
teleport_cost = trigger.teleport_cost;

while (1 &lt; 2)
{
    trigger waittill("trigger", player);
    player zm_score::minus_to_player_score(teleport_cost);
    // Do teleport stuff...
}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
Please lend me your knowledge on how I can access this KVP via GSC.  (Please do not suggest workarounds, I would like to use the KVP.)<br /> <br />Thanks!<br /> <br />Edit: fixed minus_to_player_score call, wrote it incorrectly from memory.</p>

<p>Reply By: Dan9977<br />Not a fix but &quot;&lt;2&quot; is not necessary &quot;while(1)&quot; does the job, and make it minus the teleport cost not just 1500.</p>

I typed this from another computer, it minuses the teleport cost in the actual script, I just wasn&#39;t thinking when I typed this out.  Good catch ;)</p>

You&#39;ll need to put a cost in manually or define it in the beginning of the script.</blockquote><br /> No, that&#39;s definitely possible. I think the script should work, but just to be sure, can you send us a picture of your KVPs in radiant?</p>

Everything is fine on the radiant side.</p>

teleport_cost = trigger.cost;
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
instead of:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
teleport_cost = trigger.teleport_cost;
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
