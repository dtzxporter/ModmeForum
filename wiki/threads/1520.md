Thanks for any help you can give, All is appreciated greatly!<br /> <br />I have been unable to hide more than one tag within the weapon files in APE<br />As soon as I add more than a single tag to hide (all individual tags work)<br />either only the first tag or none of the tags are hidden.<br /> <br />So far, I&#39;ve tried parsing my tags differently as follows (disregard &quot; &quot; as it quotes exact input within):<br /> <br />&quot;Tag_1<br />Tag_2<br />Tag_3&quot;<br /> <br />&quot;Tag_1,<br />Tag_2,<br />Tag_3&quot;<br /> <br />&quot;Tag_1, <br />Tag_2, <br />Tag_3&quot;<br /> <br />[in the last set above, tags are followed with a comma then a space before continuing to next line]<br /> <br />I&#39;ve also made sure that there isn&#39;t a blank line proceeding the final tag, looking something like this:<br /> <br />...<br />Tag_3<br />|<br /> <br />[&quot;|&quot; this being the blinking typing cursor that we&#39;re all familiar with, within the above example]<br /> <br />Picture(s):<br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MqCHFuN" frameborder="0"></iframe><br />(I&#39;ll add more with time)<br /> <br />Thank you again for your time and assistance!<br />
