<p>Thread By: Undefeatable<br />Custom Guns Mega Pack has 100 weapons. Some of the weapons in CGMP have download links by El Ricos, Itznvy (John Burnette), ProRevenge, coxinator115, xxsanchez, &amp; Jia909 while other weapons do not have download links. I have problems that Tito Pricus&#39; weapon links were not here. And oh! I have ideas. Custom weapons were put in custom maps for these high rounds of arsenal w/ pap. The first custom map w/ custom weapons is Halloween Zombie Map by Zeroy. MTS255, M1 Garand, AK-47, M16A4, M1911, &amp; Model 1887 were the first custom weapons to be put in the custom map. These weapons were first created by Tito Pricus, ConvictioNDR, &amp; Rollonmath42. And in these custom maps, there are major easter eggs which have bosses. The first easter egg boss to be discovered is Grim Reaper in Zeroy&#39;s December map: A Christmas Carol. The second time w/ custom weapons in this map is Christmas Zombies Map. These custom weapons were from Ricos even M1927 from BO2 replaced to M1927 from Revelations. Welcome to my topic! No interferences!</p>

<p>Reply By: Undefeatable<br />How did you put weapons to Custom Guns Mega Pack? It appears that all weapons are displayed in all maps except major custom maps.</p>
