<p>This may not have anything to do with scripting, but I am not sure were to post this.<br /><br />So I made a room that you can walk in and when you shoot your gun I want it to<strong>echo as if it were in a room and not outdoors.</strong> I am wondering if there is something that needs to be added in radiant.</p>
