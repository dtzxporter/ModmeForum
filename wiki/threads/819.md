<p>Thread By: lilmayo<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Is there anyway I can make it so that when the player turns on power, a plane crashing sound plays and one of the buildings and courtyards in my map that was previously not destroyed becomes all destroyed with wreckage from a huge plane in it? I don&#39;t need to actually make a plane flying in the sky since I&#39;ll make it so the power switch is inside and far away from the actual courtyard. I just need to know if it&#39;s possible, and how? </p></p>

<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br /><p style="text-align:left;">I do not map so as far as making the building actually change Idk how to do that. But as for the sound/script here is what you would do: </p>{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
function cinematic_power
{
	level flag::wait_till( "power_on" ); 
	wait(5); // give it some time 
	PlaySoundToTeam( "custom_sound_here", "allies" );
	// This is where you would do the effects on the house
}

{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br /><br /><br /><p style="text-align:left;">and you would need to thread that in your function main like so: </p>{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
level thread cinematic_power();

{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
</p>
