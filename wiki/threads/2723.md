<p>Hi guys <br /><br />I’m making a walking dead based map which is a WIP and I’m wondering if anyone is able to help me in the way of making a custom Lucille (barber wire baseball bat) to import to the map <br /><br />I’ve very little knowledge in this area of mapmaking, as I’m mostly a builder but don’t get too involved in weapon models and anims and whatnot. <br /><br />Is anyone able to help my achieve what I want <br /><br />Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Try porting the Fallout 4 bat. That game has a barbed wire variant.</p>
