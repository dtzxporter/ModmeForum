<p>I&#39;ve been working on a map for around 2 weeks, been working flawlessly. Until tonight I added a room and it will no longer open in radiant. Anyone know how to fix this?</p>

<p>The only simple way that I can think of:<br /><br />-go to your folder Call of Duty Black Ops III\radiant\autosave_backup<br />and there you will see continuous copies of security with the date on which it was made <br />-copy one of them and go to  Call of Duty Black Ops III\map_source\zm <br />and there you paste it and change the exact name of your map for example: zm_xxxxxxx.map<br /><br />I hope that helps you</p>
