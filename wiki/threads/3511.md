<p>&lt;h2&gt;ABNORMAL202&#39;S WINDRUNNER WHISKEY (v1.1.0) [A BO3 Custom Perk]&lt;/h2&gt;<br /><br />&lt;h3&gt;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Pictures</span></strong>&lt;/h3&gt;<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/976604071429133633/AA8D1DEDBF05510D4FBFF9EB125D104F358E8DBB/.png"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.922.png' | relative_url }}"><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.923.png' | relative_url }}"><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.924.png' | relative_url }}"><br /><br />&lt;h3&gt;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Videos</span></strong>&lt;/h3&gt;<br /><br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9--HwFwLIbs" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br />&lt;h3&gt;<span style="text-decoration: underline">What Is Windrunner Whiskey?</span>&lt;/h3&gt;<br /><br />After the player sprints for 1 second, they charge up a blast of air which knocks all zombies away in a very amusing fashion as soon as they come into contact with a zombie. This ability resets on a cooldown of 12 seconds. In addition, if a player jumps from a high enough height, they will create a shockwave that kills all nearby zombies - this ability has no cooldown but requires you get high. Specific values for this perk can be edited in the .gsh if you feel it is not balanced.<br /><br />Windrunner Whiskey comes with it&#39;s own original model made by <a href="http://aviacreations.com/modme/index.php?view=forumprofile&uid=1445">Lethal Peelz</a>, as well as it&#39;s own shader, bottle, FX, Vulture Aid Waypoint, and perk jingle.<br /><br />&lt;h3&gt;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">How Do I Install It In My Map?</span></strong>&lt;/h3&gt;<br /><br />The download includes instructions for installation within the instructions.txt file.<br /><br /><strong>IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE YOU HAVE HARRYBO21&#39;S PERKS (v2.1 or higher) INSTALLED FIRST!!!</strong><br /><br />&lt;h3&gt;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">NOTES</span></strong>&lt;/h3&gt;<br /><br />If you happen to make custom perks too, Windrunner Whiskey uses the specialty: &quot;specialty_sprintfire&quot;, so I recommend not using that, if you want it to be compatible with Windrunner Whiskey. <br /><br />I haven&#39;t modded in years and after seeing new comments on my old custom perks Snail&#39;s Pace Slurpee and Cryo-Slide Soda, I remembered I had made this whole perk but never released it. This is a very low-effort release, I&#39;m really just releasing the link to a .rar that was made years ago... If there are issues with Harry&#39;s perks now or whatever, I&#39;m sorry I have not updated it in anyway. I&#39;m sure this can be made to work without harry&#39;s perks as well, but if someone wants to do that, they will have to figure it out themselves, sorry. (NOTE: if you do figure this out and want to share it with others, message me and I can put it on here, with credit of course). <br /><br />Also like I said, haven&#39;t modded in years, haven&#39;t tested this in years either, so sorry if it is buggy. I do know for a fact someone has gotten this exact .rar to work in their map without problems, so I hope others will not encounter any.<br /><br />Have a Happy Honda Days<br /><br /><br />&lt;h3&gt;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Credits</span></strong>&lt;/h3&gt;<br /><br />PLEASE CREDIT THESE PEOPLE IF YOU AREN&#39;T ALREADY!<br /><br />-Abnormal202<br />-Harrybo21<br />-Lethal Peelz<br /><br />&lt;h3&gt;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Download</span></strong>&lt;/h3&gt;<br /><br /><a href="https://mega.nz/file/js4SVCrI#ucNNnLAAFU0v2y5MeufFTOmA5d1_1nshX81ItpllmaA">Download</a></p>
