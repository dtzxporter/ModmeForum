<p>Thread By: n2nshadow<br />I&#39;ve been trying to rip models for a CoD4 map.<br /> <br />I got almost everything to work but I&#39;m running into a issue on several models.<br /> <br />They appear to have 2 models overlaying each other.  The normal one and then the destroyed one.  I&#39;ve tried exporting additional LOD&#39;s in wraith, but that didn&#39;t work.  <br /> <br />Here is a screenshot, looking for any advice, thanks.<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i66.tinypic.com/2vwitf5.jpg"></p>
