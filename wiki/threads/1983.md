<p>Thread By: Fil he Modder<br />ok so basically, i noticed that in some treyarch maps such as the giant, some of the patches have been placed in in such a way that when you delete the patch, there is a perfect hole where it used to be, does anybody know how to do it? or do i have to do it manually? i feel as if that would be extremely useful</p>
