I assume they are similar to fx and that exploder::exploder(&quot;exploder_name&quot;) would be defining it in my gsc. But is it like an fx when I call it to be used? And how do I see what exploders I have to choose from? Are all efx&#39;s exploders? Can I call it similarly to this? <br />playfx(level._effect[&quot;powerup_grabbed&quot;]</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />no<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
exploder::stop_exploder( "exploder_name" ); // stop exploder
exploder::exploder( "exploder_name" ); // start exploder
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />there isnt a list of exploders - they are lights in radiant, you get 1 or a group of them and make them &quot;into&quot; a exploder<br /> <br />they are nothing to do with fx, they are so you can control lights from script, as the light functions in the api are now deprecated</p>

<p>Reply By: modric<br />I have this in my script and have the #using exploder in my gsc... I couldnt find how to actaully make an exploder in radiant so i tried a scriptable light with the zns_light targetname seen in this script<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
exploder::exploder( "zns_light" );
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
