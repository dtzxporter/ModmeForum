<p>Thread By: TrueGamerCalls<br />It saves in radiant, but no matter what I do nothing I did in radiant will appear in game, even if I add a 50 inch dildo in the middle of the map (Joking) it wouldn&#39;t appear at all. Once again it saves in radiant but not in game. I compile link run and lights at high. Can anyone help?</p>
