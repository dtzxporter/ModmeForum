<p>Thread By: Astaal<br />Essentially, I want the player to stand on a teleporter inside a volume with a sepia LUT material and then teleport to another volume with a separate LUT applied. However, the only way to change a LUT is inside the properties of a worldspawn entity, which you can only have one of -- is there anyway to trigger this to change?<br /> <br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/e4wVl2W.png"></p>
