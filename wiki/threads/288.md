<p>Thread By: Kierpok<br />me and my friend are making a map and he sent me a prefab of what he made and when I put it in my map it was a red box what I could not move or delete, and now every time I try to run the game it opens bo3 for a second and then crashes any one got an idea how to remove those prefabs</p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />If you can&#39;t select it, try drawing a brush around it, right clicking, and click on &quot;select touching&quot; or &quot;select inside&quot;. This worked for me.</p>
