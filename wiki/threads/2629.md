<p>Whenever i put a reflection probe in a room and go in game, the room is completely white and i cant see a thing. an example: <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.48.jpg' | relative_url }}"></p>

<p>Have you set up the sun volume and made sure the worldspawn settings are using the same ssi as the sun volume? This may fix it.<br /> Also it seems lighting is not being calculated at all here so make sure the reflection probe is set up properly and that it is not overlapping others. Try recreating it as this has fixed a lot of issues for me in the past.</p>

<p>I figured it out myself. I was just using a texture that was invisible.</p>
