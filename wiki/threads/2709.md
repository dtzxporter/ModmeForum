<p>Hi<br />I have a unbuilt lightning in map, so I hit the lightning icon to built as always, but when I do and finish it appears the message &quot;Unbuilt lightning - Hit the lightning icon again&quot;<br />But when I do that, Radiant crash or just the message appears again<br />Anyone know what can I do?<br /><br />---------------------<br />Edit:<br />Already fix, my video memory wasn&#39;t enough<br />Thanks</p>
