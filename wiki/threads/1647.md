<p>Thread By: badtumshie<br />Hi, I was trying to port a model from Halo 3. I have converted the model from 3dsmax to Maya and then to BO3 using Kronos. I have all of the normal maps, texture maps etc and have no problem setting them up in APE. But they become all screwed up, ie. the textures aren&#39;t mapped to the right places on the model. Images below: (anyone who hasn&#39;t played halo, this vehicle is called a wraith if you need to see what it is supposed to look like.)<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/ClpMBIZ.png"><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/aPvf2MO.png"><br />The reason that the wraith is split into 2 seperate models is that they both have individual texture maps. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p>

I take it that this is what you meant:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/ceuVRat.png"><br />The textures didn&#39;t carry across to Maya....I just thought that it could be fixed in APE after using the COD Tools to get the model. Here is a screenshot from what it looked like in 3dsMax:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/ymyGhFr.png"><br /> <br />Edit: Also, It might be worth mentioning that I have managed to port models from halo 4 before in a similar circumstance (no textures in maya) and the textures just mapped themselves correctly in APE without trouble.</p>

<p>Reply By: DTZxPorter<br />I recommend opening the UV editor and checking, it&#39;s most likely messed up in maya, and no, you can&#39;t edit it in APE, you need to fix them in maya as well. What format are you using to go from 3DSMax - Maya</p>

Here are some screens:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/WzyTMQ7.png"><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/X4AxbvU.png"><br />So, what should I do? Should I map the textures to the model in Maya before exporting? Or should i Use a different format eg. FBX?<br /> <br />Edit: Ok, so I used .FBX and the textures carried across to Maya mapped correctly. But when I tried to export using CODMayaTools I got this error:<br /> <br />Traceback (most recent call last):<br />File &quot;C:/Users/badtumshie/Documents/maya/2014-x64/scripts\CoDMayaTools.py&quot;, line 3031, in GeneralWindow_ExportSelected<br />exec(&quot;response = %s(\&quot;%s\&quot;)&quot; % (OBJECT_NAMES[windowID][4], filePath))<br />File &quot;&lt;string&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;&lt;/module&gt;&lt;/string&gt;<br />File &quot;C:/Users/badtumshie/Documents/maya/2014-x64/scripts\CoDMayaTools.py&quot;, line 1160, in ExportXModel<br />shapes = GetShapes(joints)<br />File &quot;C:/Users/badtumshie/Documents/maya/2014-x64/scripts\CoDMayaTools.py&quot;, line 1504, in GetShapes<br />polyIter.getUVs(Us, Vs)<br />File &quot;c:\builds\maya-2014-w64\build\Release\runTime\Python\Lib\site-packages\maya\OpenMaya.py&quot;, line 8298, in getUVs<br />RuntimeError: (kInvalidParameter): No element at given index<br /> <br />I have had this error numerous times, and would be very grateful if you could tell me how I might go about solving it....it has led to me abandoning many model ports.</p>

<p>Reply By: DTZxPorter<br />Does this model have <em>multiple UV layers</em> by chance?</p>

<p>Reply By: badtumshie<br />I don&#39;t know....texture was only on one of the 4 quadrants of the UV browser (top right) if that means anything to you. Only the bottom half was selected (the main body), but I did notice that there were 2 sets of normal/colour map pairs. I&#39;m away from my computer just now, but I&#39;ll update with pics tomorrow. Thanks again for helping...have a win for your trouble.</p>
