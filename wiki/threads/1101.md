And I think zeroy did it through Hud elements in his map</p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />For coop: I have no idea<br />For solo:<br /> <br />Make a mkv file of your image or just copy/paste a video in blackops3/video and rename it to <br /> <br />zm_mapname_load.mkv<br /> <br />for sound, I have no idea.<br /> <br />Nothing in the zone file</p>
