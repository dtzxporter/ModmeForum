<p>Thread By: Abnormal202<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Hey, I&#39;ve hardly worked with trigger multiples/radiuses, but I&#39;m trying to make a script where it will rotate an object while the player stands in a trigger multiple or a trigger radius, and then starts rotating back the other way when he is not standing on it. The only way I know to trigger something in script using a trigger in radiant is with:</p>{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
triggername waittill( "trigger", player);

{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br /><br /><br /><p style="text-align:left;">But I don&#39;t think I can use just that to make a function like the one I described above. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a way to do this, afterall the script for soul chests must check for zombies to be in a certain radius of an object, so how can I do that with players? I&#39;ve tried looking through MakeCents&#39; grow_soul.GSC but most of that stuff just goes over my head.</p></p>
