<p>Thread By: fusorf<br />Not saying I will keep doing this forever, but right now I would like to help the community by making Black Ops 2 styled loading screens / loading videos for your map. <br /><br /><br /><br />Reply or pm, with various screenshots from your map.<br /><br />And artistic directions if you have an idea on how you want it to look like.<br /><br /><br /><br />Example:<br /><br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lbqSlzQh3DQ" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br /><br /><br />ProRevenge&#39;s Encampment:<br /><br /><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/37/1473887446-encampment-load-1920x1080.png"><br /><br /><br /><br />- fusorf</p>

<p>Reply By: ProRevenge<br />This looks like quality work you do, and I&#39;m actually in need of a new loading image and menu image for my update for Encampment, if you could help out that would be great :)<br /><br />I can send whatever you need screenshot wise, and if you will help I will give an idea of how it could look, I don&#39;t have much to repay with aside from early map access :)</p>
