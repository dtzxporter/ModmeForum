<p>Hello guys so I&#39;ve been working on adding 2 areas of the map, one on the moon and one not, I was wondering if multiple skyboxes was possible one for each area along with that I keep having issues with custom skyboxes not working, ending up as the default error color. Is there any way to fix this issue? I&#39;ve tried numerous different images but all end up that way. Here are a few screenshots of the issues. <br /><br />Any help would be greatly appreciated the final screenshot shows the two separate parts of the map, one with the main skybox and the other part without one, <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1074.png' | relative_url }}"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1075.png' | relative_url }}"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1076.png' | relative_url }}"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1077.png' | relative_url }}"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1078.png' | relative_url }}"></p>
