<p>I can&#39;t upload my map because of this error. Ive seen people fix this by uploading a 512x512 thumbnail image. Ive done this but didn&#39;t fix anything. Ive recompiled mulitple times, deleted xpaks multiple times, rebooted mod tools and pc, and ive also validated the mod tools. Ive also tried publishing other maps and I get the error then too. Does somebody know how to fix this? Ive put 1000&#39;s of hours into this map.<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.217.png' | relative_url }}"></p>
