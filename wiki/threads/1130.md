<p>Thread By: MJPW<br />Hi there! Im needing help with a script to make a simple Easter Egg where if the player shot certain letters on a sign in the correct order a door would open to a hidden item. This is much like the LOL Easter Egg from Point Of Contact except like I mentioned its for a hidden door. Lets say the word spelled &quot;FIDO&quot; well they would need to shoot F I D and O in that order or it would reset. I think it would work better with triggers that way you could drag a trigger damage over just the letter.</p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />I made a similar ee but to shoot 935 in order on a number pad on my map &quot;935 forest&quot; if you want to test it out. Here&#39;s the script. It&#39;s horribly written but might help you.<br /> <br /> <br />n = needed<br />d = done<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
