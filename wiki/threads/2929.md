<p>Hello all, <br />Iâ€™m looking to change the faces of the 4 characters that you get in your map: (Edward, Tank, Nikolai and Takeo).<br /><br />What I mean is that I put their models into an animation software (maybe maya), and remove their face models, then I make my own. I essentially want to make 4 of my friends faces, who will be the main characters in my map. <br /><br />If anyone has any tutorials on how to do it, please reference them or let me know a way to do it. I am super unfamiliar with Maya and making models, so honestly ANYTHING and any help with model making will help me.<br /><br />Regards,<br />The_bibba_boy</p>
