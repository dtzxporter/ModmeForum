<p>And I managed to fix it. There might be a type in some of your KVPs? I know you said you&#39;ve redone all yuor zones, but look through the KVPs and see if there are any typos. I had accidentally writte &quot;script_notworthy&quot; instead of &quot;script_noteworthy&quot; which cause me to die when I spawned in. <br /><br />Looks like the problem is most likely the starting zone though as you die when you spawn in.</p>

I would copy a starting zone that works in a different map and paste it into your new map</p>
