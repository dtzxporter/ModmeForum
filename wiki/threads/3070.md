<p>Hey Guys, so I&#39;m currently working on a new Naruto / Konoha village map . However I&#39;ve been stuck for a couple of days now trying to get custom zombie models in. I&#39;ve made sure that the skeleton is binded everytime to the mesh in Maya, as  well as painting over the skins (however the models I already downloaded were rigged). I made sure that the models also had the correct settings in Ape but no matter what model I use, they will always spawn in but with no animations, and just t-pose glide across the map following me (lol). I should also mention that they also can&#39;t be damaged for some reason but can hit me, and that they don&#39;t make any zombie noises, only the riser noise coming up from the ground. If anyone could help me in anyway at all I would be grateful, thank you.<br /><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.515.jpg' | relative_url }}"><br /><br />*p.s. this is the video I was following for intructions:<br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ijJnXDRd-o4:3043" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

<p><blockquote>Where do I get a zombie skeleton from?<br /></blockquote><br />I have never successfully done this (maya hates my pc) but was told you Import a zombie model and delete the mesh(s) leaving only the skeleton and you scale the model down to match the skeleton and align the model best you can to the skeleton and then adjust the skeleton to match up with the model...... but take that with a grain of salt....You could also pay KillJoy to do it but right now he is working on a project for me so you may have to wait a bit.<br /><br />I love your map idea though, I always wanted to make a naruto themed map with jutsus and everything, before I realized I lack the skill/time to learn how to do it all..</p>
