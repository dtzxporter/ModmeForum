<p>Alright so I&#39;ve got a teleport system that I&#39;m working on and it&#39;s going really well, but my next step to make it perfect is doing the FX properly. Currently I&#39;ve got this piece of code that doesn&#39;t work. no FX show up. If someone could tell me the &quot;proper&quot; way to spawn delete and do what I want with FX that&#39;d be great.<br /><br />

<br /><br />The teleporter trigger is linked to the struct in the middle<br /><br />

<br /><br />Any help would really be appreciated :)</p>

<p>Since you appear to be doing this in GSC, you need to change <pre>self.portal_fx SetModel( &quot;script_origin&quot; );</pre> to <pre>self.portal_fx SetModel( &quot;tag_origin&quot; );</pre>. To stop the FX, just delete the model, ie. <pre>self.portal_fx Delete();</pre>.<br /><br />If you want better control over FX, you&#39;ll need to do them in CSC (normally via clientfields).<br /><br />EDIT 2: You should actually use <pre>PlayFXOnTag( PORTAL_LOOP_FX, self.portal_fx, &quot;tag_origin&quot; );</pre> instead of the last line.</p>

Appreciate the reply :)</p>
