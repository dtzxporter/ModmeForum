<p>Thread By: Artleck<br />So lately i managed to make my own characters for my map, And i was wondering how i would make the icons for them. Strangely enough the points are also missing from the side part, Here is a picture to show what i mean.<br /><br />

<p>Reply By: Fil he Modder<br />go into ape, go to the playerbodystyle, first thing you&#39;ll see is an image, just press the icon to the right to make a new image and apply a 512 x 512 TIFF image, hope that helps :)</p>
