<p>Thread By: Dick_Nixon<br />So I&#39;ve followed the Zeroy&#39;s mod tools wiki&#39;s tutorial for the advance custom playermodels, and I have gotten all the way up to the part where I have to bind a thirdperson(MPC) body to a BO3 rig. I have tried a multitude of things, all of which don&#39;t bind correctly to the MPC rig. The problem, as identified by the mod tools, is the fact that there are extra bones in the skeleton. I have tried multiple combinations of BO3 skeletons, and BO1/2 playermodels, going so far as to bind the TG Dempsey model to it&#39;s own skeleton(which as confirmed by JBird and his video that I commented on, that the Dempsey model from TG can be used to create a custom playermodel) and I&#39;ve gotten the same problem that the mod tools sees too many bones in the model. I&#39;ve tried to remove these bones and bind the model, and that doesn&#39;t work correctly, nor does binding the model then removing the bones. Has anyone got information/experience on how to solve this?</p>
