Try Link &amp; Compile before opening in radient (if its a brand new map) other wise link and compile with &quot;ignore errors&quot; box checked. then try opening in radient. Heads up mod tools are pretty big so a big key is Patience and Waiting for things to load.</p>

Think I will have to re-install the tools, good to know what the textures for, thanks guys. :) <br /> <br />Also would you happen to know what the mystery box is called in APE?</p>
