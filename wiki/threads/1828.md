<p>Thread By: Wild<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Hey everyone. I recently ported over the staff holder from Origins. I have ported many models so I know how to do it and all that but this model just isnt working for me. I got it ported and fixed the textures and in APE the material looks fine as you can see below:</p><p style="text-align:left;"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/vftn7Xl.jpg"></p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">Now for the weird part. In radiant when I look at the model without lighting (f7) the model looks decent as you can see:</p><p style="text-align:left;"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/9foauN9.jpg"></p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">Now when I use f8 and look at with light, well it looks like shit:</p><p style="text-align:left;"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/cAfg9cX.jpg"></p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">I have tried editing all the settings in APE and nothing seems to make it look good. I have tried on 2 different maps of mine that have different lighting of course but no matter what the model looks like shit. I&#39;ve used refelction probes so none of that is the problem and like I said I know how to port and have ported many models that work fine. I just can&#39;t seem to get it working. Any help? Maybe someone could try porting it themselves and see how it turns out and if ut&#39;s good maybe you could share your setting in APE.</p></p>
