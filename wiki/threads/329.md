<p>Thread By: Pipi<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Hello!</p><p style="text-align:left;">I made a map with a dark and large forest, but when I am trying to add reflexion probe in certain area the forest become brighter.</p><p style="text-align:left;">We can&#39;t see it in radiant, it is still dark, only in-game. Does someone got a link to a good tutorial about how to put probes oustide or could explain why it acts like this?</p><p style="text-align:left;">thank you.</p></p>
