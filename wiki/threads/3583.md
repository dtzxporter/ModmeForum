<p>I was getting a massive error recently when compiling the map and I could not find a fix online for it.. until now<br /><br />the error was:<br /><br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
(WindingAreaWithKnownNormal( wInner, plane ) &lt;= 0)

F:\SteamLibraryB\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops III\bin\cod2map64.exe
q:\t7\pc\code\tools\cod2map\tris_mergeconcave.cpp:454

{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br /><strong><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1034.png' | relative_url }}"></strong><br /><br />With buttons &quot;Abort&quot;, &quot;Retry&quot;, and &quot;Ignore&quot;.<br /><br />If you&#39;re getting this error, simply make your skybox bigger as the cause of this error was geo being placed outside the map. Hopefully when someone searches this up now will see this post :)<br /><br />Credit:<br />Thanks to Jules who actually told me how to fix this :D Just posting so more people can see</p>
