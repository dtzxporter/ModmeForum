<p>Thread By: tessub2<br />I modified a .LUA file extracted from Wraith that was decompiled through Zorteok and am not seeing any changes in-game. The widget was loaded through my maps *.csc file. Is there something i&#39;m missing? Does L3akmod convert these back to *.LUA automatically or no? (I assume i&#39;m not prechaching a .LUA that already exists. It&#39;s zmammo_clipfactory.luad btw.)</p>
