<p>Thread By: _Mr. Unp3rf3ct<br />Hi there. I have a projectile weapon file in ape and I was wondering how to make it into a specialists weapon. I changed a few things to make it a hero weapon, but I don&#39;t have the charge on my dpad. Also I can pull it out even with 0 ammo. Could anyone provide me with an example projectile weapon File in a gdt?</p>
