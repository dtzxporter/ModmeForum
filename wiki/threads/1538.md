<p>Thread By: adamk570<br />Ok, so I have been porting things from bo2 over to bo3 for a few days now but one item I am having issues with is corn from transit. For whatever reason, this will not work and I assume it is because it is an animated model. I am fairly new to this stuff and I simply cant figure this out.</p>
