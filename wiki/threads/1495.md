<p>Thread By: The Black Death<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Okay so I&#39;ve lined up and set the mag for the nail gun viewmodel as a submodel (and did the same for the worldmodel) but in game the mag doesnt appear. what do I need to do to get the mag to appear in-game?</p></p>

<p>Reply By: The Black Death<br /><p style="text-align:left;">It turns out I didn&#39;t do the models properly; the mag cannot be a separate model and I didn&#39;t also bind them properly. Thanks to Rico for the fix.</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">Can mark as answered now.</p></p>
