<p>So I&#39;ve come to find out bo3&#39;s sound works a lot like the old saying &quot;if a tree falls in the middle of the woods and no one is around to hear it. Does it make a sound?&quot; In bo3&#39;s case, it doesn&#39;t.<br /><br />If I try to play a 3d sound and no one is in the range of the sound about to be played, it just doesn&#39;t play.<br />Is there a way to play a 3d sound and the sound play without someone being nearby to hear it start , or is this just how the engine is?</p>
