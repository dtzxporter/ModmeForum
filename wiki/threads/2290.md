<p>Thread By: mathfag<br />BLACK OPS 3<br /> <br />I made the masher trap next to double tap in Der Eisendrache. It took me longer than I&#39;d care to admit *cough cough 2 days cuz i fucked up and im lazy af cough*. It&#39;s a dran&#39;n&#39;drop folder but there are also some instructions in it for sound.<br /> <br />You can edit some paramaters like how many times is goes up and down, cost, cooldown and speed (how long it takes to go up or down)<br /> <br /> <br /> update:17.04.2017<br /> <br /><a href="https://mega.nz/#!XtwBFAiK!gy84chNbmTeG-TJYlY2_rJB4cM2OB9bYMu0FuZUua_Q">Download</a> <br /> <br /> If there are any problems feel free to ask. <br /> <br />Instructions for the newbs:<br /> <br />Paste the following into your zone file (usermaps/your_map/zone_source/your_map.zone):<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
scriptparsetree,scripts\_SDFM\zm_castle_gate.gsc
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />Paste this to the top of your your_map.gsc (usermaps/your_map_/scripts/zm/your_map.gsc):<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
#using scripts\_SDFM\zm_castle_gate;
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />and this in the same script but under function main(); under zm_usermap::main();<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
thread zm_castle_gate::init();
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br /><blockquote><em>FiveSeven</em><br />Nice job man, I really love when people release new traps. Looks good.  Also It would be awesome if you could put exactly where you need to init. the script and how to call it in the zone file because a lot of people are not going to know how to do so.  Just a friendly suggestion so more people will use it.   I&#39;m going to go squash some zombies with your trap now.  Thanks for sharing man.</blockquote><br /> this is the kind of things you guys need to start &quot;learning&quot; and not just having it all done for you<br /> <br />Init = the same EVERYTIME and something you should learn pretty quick<br />How to add a asset, whether it be script or otherwise, to ZONE - also the same EVERYTIME<br /> <br />not being an ass, but you NEED to know these things. Its practically like needing a door handles instrucions</p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br /><blockquote><em>CraftDAnimations</em><br />Just tested this out on a blank map and as soon as I spawn in I die.  Any idea what is causing this?</blockquote><br /> I recall having this error at some point and i think i fixed it by (in your mapname.gsc) making a function called &quot;traps&quot; and from there i threaded this script but i&#39;m not sure. I think is has to do with the waittill power_on in the first function.<br /> <br />Option 2: thread the script, do <br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
thread zm_castle_gate::setup();
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />instead of<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
zm_castle_gate::setup();
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />EDIT:<br />init() not setup()</p>
