<p>Hey all,<br /><br />I recently made a tunnel intended to walk through. However, when the player tries to walk through the tunnel, he just gets &quot;stuck&quot;. He only enters and exits the tunnel in a crouched position. Im not sure why this is happening. <br /><br />The tunnel is more than big enough to fit the player through it; I confirmed this with the player model in Radiant. I also checked to see if I have any clips, and I have nothing. Nothing is restricting the player to walk in or out of the tunnel, so Im not sure what my issue is. <br /><br />If anyone knows a solution to this, please let me know.<br /><br />Regards, <br /><br />the_bibba_boy</p>

<p>Ah the old invisible wall problem. <br />I haven&#39;t come across that for a while now. What it is usually is two overlapping brushes (for example, it might overlap by 1 unit height)<br />When the map gets compiled, it tries to compensate the error, but instead, spits out an invisible wall which you can&#39;t select, can&#39;t see and can&#39;t delete. <br />What you need to do is put the entire area into a &quot;prefab&quot; and find out where the problem is exactly. When you save it as a prefab, make a backup, and use process of elimination (start deleting wall sections) until you find the problem. Test it, then re-stamp it when you have found and fixed it.</p>

Good thing is that the tunnel area is a prefab already, but I think I know what to delete. I have a “Lit” texture and a “lit decal” texture combined over one another, so maybe that’s causing the issue. I’ll give it a try when I have the chance. Thanks!</p>

<p>select the patches connected to the invisible wall, right click, use expensive collision</p>

<p><blockquote>select the patches connected to the invisible wall, right click, use expensive collision<br /></blockquote><br />I will try that before Rage’s method, thanks!</p>

<p><blockquote>select the patches connected to the invisible wall, right click, use expensive collision<br /></blockquote><br />I finally got around to fixing this and the “use expensive collision” option didn’t work, and I did compile and link it. Thanks for your suggestion though.</p>

I thought my issue may have been the 2 tunnels on top of each other but that didn’t work. I’ll retry some possibilities tomorrow, and maybe even just rebuild the tunnel. Thanks for replying.</p>

(and fix it)</p>
