<p>When I run my map, models and brushes will appear and completely disappear...I know that sunlight has to get into the map, so I have cut a hole in the roof in every room and nothing has worked. Any help would be great, thanks!</p>

Delete half the models and see if the problem is still occurring. You may have hit an upper limit of amount of models in a map.</p>

<p>Do they disappear when you move away from them and reappear when you move closer to them..</p>
