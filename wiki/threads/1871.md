<p>Thread By: Ethan87<br />Black ops 3 crashes with no error message, but creates a dump file. I&#39;ve looked into the dump file, and bo3 is throwing an access violation error.<br /> <br />Here is a screenshot<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/4IU1AG2.png"><br /> <br />I&#39;m running windows 10 creators update, all drivers up to date, already verified black ops 3 and the mod tools.</p>

<p>Reply By: Wild<br />I don&#39;t know if this would even be a thing, but did you make sure everything has access on your firewall? Sometimes if 1 little thing isn&#39;t allowed it crashes the entire thing. I don&#39;t even know if that would be the problem but it doesn&#39;t hurt to look I suppose.</p>
