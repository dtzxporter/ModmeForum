<p>I want to draw out a script brushmodel for a minecraft chest. When a player approaches it and presses F, I want the a sound to be played and I want the lid of the chest to flip/rotate up. I want the players to be either rewarded 10,000 points, or a part to Sphynx&#39;s buildable power or packapunch.<br /><br />If someone could assist in this process that would be amazing!!</p>
