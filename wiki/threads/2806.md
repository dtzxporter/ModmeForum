<p>I&#39;ve been trying to port xmodels from DLC maps for awhile now but no matter what I try, I always get some kind of error. The first time I managed to get a few good xmodels, but most of them ended up having white spots and missing textures. Every time since I&#39;ve gotten nothing but texture-less cubes. I&#39;ve tried troubleshooting and I&#39;ve followed multiple tutorials to the letter and I&#39;ve made no progress. Now with school and work taking up most of my days, I don&#39;t have a lot of free time to figure out what I&#39;m doing wrong, so I&#39;m looking for &#39;professional&#39; help to get some xmodels for a current map I&#39;m working on and future maps. If you&#39;re willing to help, I&#39;ll PM the details to you. Have a great day! :)</p>

If you could help with that it&#39;d be very much appreciated. I&#39;ll PM the details later today because I&#39;ve got to get going soon. :)</p>

If you want assets, fine, go ahead and ask, but if anyone&#39;s charging you for it ? hmm..I wouldn&#39;t want to be on the receiving end of that legal letter. :D</p>

Then load game on greyhound, and search for the model (if you don&#39;t see xmodels you need to activate that option in the settings). Also port the xmodel like you would normally do, I think there are some tutorials explaining on how to do that + porting it into maya and exporting it. Just make sure you have the plugins.</p>
