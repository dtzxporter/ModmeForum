<p>Thread By: belly3031<br />Does anyone know how I could setup my own line in the vox that I can use in my scripts? <br />So basically have the players in the game comment on something that I have called in a script. I don&#39;t want to just play the sound of their voice using something like a &quot;PlaySound ()&quot; in the script for example, because it has to be the specific player that you are playing as in the game. It wouldn&#39;t make sense if Takeo says something even though you are playing as Tank.<br /> <br />Hope that is clear enough, hope you guys can help!! :)</p>
