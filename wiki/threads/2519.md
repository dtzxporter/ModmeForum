<p>Reply By: ElTitoPricus<br />Max meshes per model in WAW is 32, anything beyond 31 will give you this error<br />try to merge and/or delete as much as you can</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />Tick ‘allowhideallparts’<br /> <br />it boosts it to 48<br /><br />that is 64 tho so still wont go through, its simply to HD for that engine, would require some serious maya work to reduce the surfaces<br /> <br />why on earth are you using lime tho - wraith ( made by this very sites owner ) is miles superior</p>
