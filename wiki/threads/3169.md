<p><blockquote>a<br /><br />Are they snapped to the walls\ceiling\floor ?<br /></blockquote><br />Yeah. Removing one from an imported level also in the map seemed to help, but it&#39;s still a little patchy. The fog is also reeeeeally bright, but that may jus tbe the combination of default_day and giant fog.</p>

<p><blockquote><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.641.png' | relative_url }}"><br /></blockquote><br />This happens when you have some light bleeding and also the patchy area&#39;s are because you don&#39;t have enough light in that room. Add a light make the radius as big as the room, set PRIMARY_NOSHADOWMAP to false. Rebuild lights just to test this, and that should fix the patchy areas. If that does fix the patchy areas, then you should delete that light, and light it properly how you want.  For the light bleeding you need to make sure that your probe is snapped to the walls by selecting the probe and press and hold CTRL and then left click the walls, ceiling, and floor. you will need more than 1 probe for this area. Once it&#39;s properly probed, and has enough light. If it&#39;s still bleeding then you may have the walls to thin never go less than 4 units for walls. Another reason could be that your corners aren&#39;t mitered. Here is an example of what mitered means - <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://gyazo.com/ea8dc6cf0e9a02d6d0b9c8155cca099c.png"><br /><a href="https://gyazo.com/ea8dc6cf0e9a02d6d0b9c8155cca099c">https://gyazo.com/ea8dc6cf0e9a02d6d0b9c8155cca099c</a></p>
