<p>Thread By: TrueGamerCalls<br />I can&#39;t seem to figure out how to replace the models with a mod, I know its possible as I&#39;ve seen custom zombie models in a mod before.<br /> <br />I&#39;ve tried this <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
aitype,archetype_zm_templar_zombie
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />yet to no prevail. <br /> <br />If anyone&#39;s wondering, I&#39;m trying to add Erthrock&#39;s templar zombies.</p>

Not just pop anything in</p>
