<p>Reply By: Exofile<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Overall it&#39;s got promise. My first suggestion would be to make it look more natural. Things like lawns etc aren&#39;t too often simply a flat surface with grass all over. Generally it can be some dirt in various locations, etc. Make sure the destruction you&#39;re adding looks good. a hole in the wall/ceiling won&#39;t just be a spiky hole. It&#39;ll have rebar, crumbles everywhere and dust around.</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p></p>

Since recieving your comment, I have improved upon the aspects that you have highlighted. I also plan for a large release tomorrow, which will improve quite a bit of detailing to the map; such as replacing vista buildings with custom ones.<p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;"></p>Here&#39;s an example of that:</p><p style="text-align:left;"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C5iruAmWQAAco_N.jpg"></p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">I hope you will continue to provide feedback, as it is highly valued ! :^)</p></p>
