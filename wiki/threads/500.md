<p>Thread By: Stonermagoo420<br />I think i am really close to getting everything on this new drive up to date to the old one i had for this pc but i just ran into this and cant figure out why it is. I have tried restarting my computer, scaning the drive for errors,verifying the integrity of my tools, watching tutorials on how to fix and no luck... i dont know why this isnt working for me at the moment i have all the files and DLC&#39;s but im a noob im sure theres something i have effed up any help would be great.<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://ibin.co/w800/3wgH5faBZ2Px.jpg"><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://ibin.co/3wgKLMXWoKMv.jpg"></p>

<p>Reply By: D-2-K<br />looks like your deffo getting there quick question do you have anti virus installed if so add BO3 and Mod tools to exceptions list and see if that helps <br /> <br />If not let me know what windows version your running and we can take it from there</p>

<p>Reply By: Stonermagoo420<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://ibin.co/3wiTFQAxYqvb.jpg"><br /> <br />okay i got this, change the names or delete the xmodels in ape. I dont think this has anything to do with radiant crashing<br />this came up after i verified files so im going to find the conflicting addon i have and redownload the tools does anyone else have anymore ideas<br />(updating bo3 and mod tools took all day and now i dont want to wait again for it to reinstall)</p>
