<p>Thread By: HeknoxryZombies<br />Hello everyone!<br /> <br />I&#39;m making a new zombies map and the map will include an objective list when you press a certain key. I was wondering if there is already an existing script for it or if there isn&#39;t maybe just a few ideas and tips you guys can give me. My idea was something similar to the WW2 objective HUD.<br /> <br />Any sort of help and advice will be greatly appreciated!<br /> <br />Thanks, guys!<br /> <br />- HeknoxryZombies</p>
