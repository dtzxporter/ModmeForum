<p>Thread By: BradyWarner<br />I was wondering if anyone knew how to add the wunderfizz into bo3 custom zombies map. I have the model from bo2 origins and need the script so it is able to work.</p>

<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br />Nobody has made a script to my knowledge yet. I wouldn&#39;t count on one coming out either as most people aren&#39;t a fan of wonderfizz, or at least most of the scripters I know lol</p>
