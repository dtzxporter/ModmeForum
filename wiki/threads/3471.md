<p>Hi, I&#39;m trying to make a health bar for the Boss in the bossfight. I got help from a friend who tryed to make a script by his own (who doesn&#39;t script for bo3 but he script for his work so he understand scripting). He took a look at the script from Symbo &amp; Harry&#39;s Attackable Soulbox that had a health bar so he tryed to understand that script and started a easy scripting for me. But it didn&#39;t work, the health bar didn&#39;t show, so am asking if Symbo or Harry is here and can make it like this to work (On an easy way), because you don&#39;t need to take a big time for helping me, but would appreciate the healp, that I finally made my own boss fight on my second last project before quitting. :)</p>
