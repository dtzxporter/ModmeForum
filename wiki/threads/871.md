<p>Thread By: Abnormal202<br /><p style="text-align:left;">I&#39;ve been trying to do some scripting with lights but it doesn&#39;t seem to work, even when I set it to scriptable. I can&#39;t move them, or perform any of the functions on them. Is there some sort of trick?</p></p>

Does it work for you? Maybe there is some other problem I&#39;m having...</p></p>

That&#39;s sad. Is there a way I could turn a light into an FX?</p></p>
