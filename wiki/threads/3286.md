<p>Probably has been asked before... So specifically how do I convert a model made in blender to an xmodel_export, is there a plug in I could use like in Maya.<br />I&#39;ve used Maya and have imported models from there but I recently made the switch to blender.</p>

<p>Export it to an OBJ and do it in Maya.....or go back to an older version of blender and use the KATSBITS plugin (if you can find it)</p>
