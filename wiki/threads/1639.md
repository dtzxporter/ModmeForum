<p>Thread By: JellyAlex<br />Hi,<br /> <br />Does anyone know how to get tom_bmx&#39;s Lime64 to extract model and image files from CoD Ghosts because whenever I run it it freezes on the first model it extracts. It gives the model file for the first but not the textures (corrupt file).<br /> <br />Even more helpful, are there any other programs that do the job better?</p>

In order to use Wraith for Ghosts you have to wait a little bit for it to be released.</p>
