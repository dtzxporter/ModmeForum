<p>Thread By: ZombieKid164<br />I keep getting this error: &quot;could not find scripts/zm/gametypes/tdm&quot; when I run my map. It&#39;s not any of my scripts, and the map just closes really quickly. I had to record to even know what the error was. Any help is greatly appreciated. <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://aviacreations.com/modme/emoticons/smile.png"></p>

What I did to fix was added folder called gametypes in map map&#39;s script folder and pasted the multiplayer tdm script there. Then I parsed it in my zone file and I believe it fixed the issue.</p>
