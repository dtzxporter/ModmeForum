<p>Thread By: MrGuacamole115<br />Hey, pretty new to radiant, have all the basics and necessities sorted. As well as detail .ect.<br /><br /> But I was wondering how to get zombies to mantle an object? Much like they do to get over barriers or railings, except without the barrier part.<br /><br /> I&#39;ve tried fiddling with the traverse brush, the mantle brush, path nodes. But can&#39;t find it. Anyone on here know who&#39;d be willing to explain? If not then that&#39;s ok ^^</p>

<p>Reply By: MrGuacamole115<br />Thanks dude, tutorial helped. Just wondering what the animscript is for a simple wall hop. I&#39;ve got the preview anim done fine just need something other than &quot;zm_jump_up_to_climb&quot;</p>
