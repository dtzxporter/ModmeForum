<p>Thread By: peterparker<br />I would like to change the hand grenade in my map to a different type, like the stielhandgranate or pineapple grenade. How do I achieve that?</p>

<p>Reply By: peterparker<br />I was under the impression both the <a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Stielhandgranate">Stielhandgranate</a> and the <a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Mk_2_Grenade">Pineapple Grenade</a> are already in the BO3 Campaign. Am I missing something?<br /> <br />Edit: Sorry, the pineapple isn&#39;t in the campaign. That looks as if it may be port-able from an earlier version...</p>

If you want to get it into your map then you&#39;ll have to port it out.</p>

<p>Reply By: peterparker<br />OK then, what am I looking for (Let&#39;s find the Stielhandgranate, since that&#39;s what I&#39;m really after)?<br /> <br /> <br />Edit: According to <a href="https://modme.co/index.php?view=topic&tid=1065">The Indestructable Mike Pence</a>, It can be ported from at least BO1 WaW, so that&#39;s good news.<br /> <br />However, the Wiki says it&#39;s already there in the base game. It should be as easy as calling it if that is the case,<br />but I cannot for the life of me find the assets in the APE or the gamefiles. Hurmf.</p>
