<p>I&#39;m not sure if this actually should be a &quot;release&quot;, but I did quite a bit of custom script for this (and I &quot;made&quot; the UV fx). I would also like to say that I have no idea who made the base for this (FX, sound, original gsc/csc) so if you do know, please let me know and I&#39;ll credit them. For now I will say sharpgamers4you is the source because that&#39;s what I was told.<br /><br /><strong>Features:</strong><br /><ul><li>Toggleable, basic flashlight<br /><li>Automatically enabled flashlight using triggers or zones<br /><li>UV light that reveals hidden objects<br /><li>UV light can be toggled while in an automatic flashlight zone<br /><li>Flashlight and UV light activation hints<br /><li>Ability to make flashlight and UV light wait for a notify before they are useable (they can use separate notifies)<br /><li>Ability to have flashlight and UV light activated per person or for all players (again, they can be changed separately)<br /></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>Note: the flashlight cannot be toggled (aside from UV) when using the automatic flashlight. I can change this if people want this to be possible<br />Note 2: the game may or may not crash when a player disconnects, if it does happen please let me know so I can fix it (I can&#39;t test it right now) &#128517;<br /><br />I would like to thank the person that originally released this for their work (whoever that may be :/ ) and I would also like credit for my work as well if you use this &#128591;.<br />I hope this helps out everyone that&#39;s looking for a flashlight :)<br /><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E1fi9HnQiOP5R7exqtnEKzyn7JEK8_nN/view?usp=sharing">Flashlight v1.0</a><br /><br />Happy mapping</p>

<p>I am not the original scripter of the function, the og one was done years ago but not from the known users, if i see the name then i will recognize it, its not a youtuber or a known mapper.<br />However it was seriously buggy so i fixed most if not all bugs but then later when i wanted to add the credits i messed up the fixed version and og version, then the og version was gone.<br />Can&#39;t remmeber if it was here or ugx but i think it was on ugx forums, however like i said i am not the original scripter of the flashlight, but i am the one holding the scripts exactly how the og version was made, then people made different versions of the ones i had</p>

The UV one is a little buggy still, mostly because I don&#39;t actually know the exact 3D geometry/math behind how the Thundergun works (I used a bit of the script from it for the sight detection). I just hope it helps everyone out that needs a flashlight, they can find the link a bit easier and it should have more than enough functionality than the average mapper will use.</p>

<p><blockquote>idk how to do that do i have to go into the gsc or...<br /></blockquote><br />Open the csc and look? It’ll have “tag_<br /><br />Something somewhere, change it?</p>

<p><blockquote>Open the csc and look? It’ll have “tag_<br /><br />Something somewhere, change it?<br /></blockquote><br />so I changed but I guess it is in my character because the characters body sometimes is covering the flashlight, or adding a shadow where it shouldn&#39;t be.</p>
