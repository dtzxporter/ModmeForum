<p>Thread By: BunkerBaerIGER<br />Hey guys, I&#39;m trying to create a custom boss for my ZM map.<br />I have all the models and xanim, but I do not know what to do next.<br />How can I write his AI if he does not behave like a zombie? How does he know what to do now?<br />On APE, I look at the zm_factory_zombie file and his behavior tree and animation selection table, but I do not know how to create it myself.<br /> <br />I don&#39;t know how i should explain that and sorry for my bad english <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://modme.co/emoticons/cheerful.png"></p>
