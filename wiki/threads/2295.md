<p>Thread By: Noah Gamerscore<br />Hey guys here is a super simple tutorial on how to add the Razorback from Black Ops 3 Multiplayer and Zetsubou No Shima to Black ops 3 Zombies Mod Tools.<br /> <br />All you have to do is go to your zm_levelcommon_weapons.csv (bo3root\share\raw\gamedata\weapons\zm)<br /> <br />look for this :<br />smg_versatile,smg_versatile_upgraded,,1300,smg,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,FALSE,TRUE,smg,,,<br /> <br />and add this under it :<br />smg_longrange,smg_longrange_upgraded,,1500,smg,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,FALSE,TRUE,smg,,<br /> <br />And that&#39;s it. You&#39;re done, its as simple as that. But sadly the gun has no firing sounds, only reload sounds. <br />But the good thing is that there is a Pack-A-Punched Version of the Razorback.<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/hMAolLu.jpg"><br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/2uD7qKD.jpg"><br />Here are some in-game pictures of the Razorback + Gullinbursti (Razorback Upgraded) for Black Ops 3 Zombies Mod Tools<br />Thanks for checking this post out. Enjoy.</p>

<p>Reply By: rossdaboss<br />Sorry if I sound rude but u shouldn&#39;t ask people to credit u for this. I&#39;ve had the razorback in my map for months now and it&#39;s not that hard to do. But definitely keep this post up because there might be some people new to mod tools who won&#39;t know how to do it themselves</p>

You should be learning to do stuff on your own anyway so instead of relying on others for the sounds just get them yourself, it&#39;s not like it&#39;s hard to do so.</p>

Not just relying on everyone else for assets. If you are missing the sounds of something, get them. It&#39;s simple, don&#39;t complain and say it&#39;s not a full tutorial. Just do it yourself.</p>
