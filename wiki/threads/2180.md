<p>Thread By: MEGAVKNG<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/Uc8O98G.png"><br /> <br />Hi there, I&#39;m MEGASEAN or MEGAVKNG, the team lead for Dreams in a Cryotank, we do mods for Halo CE, Black Ops 3, and we are also working on our own original IP.<br /> <br />This is my first time posting on here, so forgive me if I don&#39;t fit in very well. :(<br /> <br />I kinda slacked on making this thread for a while, because I didn&#39;t think I had anything worthy of noting, but here I am I guess.<br /> <br /><strong>Projects</strong><br /> <br />Various Weapon Porting Shenanigans by yours truly:<br /> <br /> <br /><br />

Carbon helped us get the BO3 part of the team started so a lot of his stuff is in the video.<br /> <br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_s1BWB3-NeQ" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /> <br />That&#39;s about all I have to show, have a good one everybody! If you have any interest in what we&#39;re doing feel free to contact me on Discord: MEGASEAN#7796</p>

<p>Reply By: MEGAVKNG<br />I&#39;m not dead, just finished this and I also have a few Ghosts ports I&#39;ll show soon.<br /> <br />I&#39;ll be adding slide animations and then its finished. If any mappers want it let me know, I would release it publicly but it requires Rico&#39;s ports (I used a material) and that&#39;d probably cause a mess of people asking why it doesn&#39;t work. <br /> <br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OwVTG0v9VXw" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /> <br />Also no sling, I hate the sling.</p>
