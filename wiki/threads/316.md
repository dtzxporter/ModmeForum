<p>Thread By: Wild<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Hello, recently I was watching one of the Divide videos by JBird and I noticed he used a sound looper for the effect of rain hitting metal or something like. Someone in the comments asked him for a list of thm and he said he didn&#39;t even really know any. I&#39;d really like to know because if there are sound loopers for what I am looking for then it could help the atmosphere of my map a ton. It would be awesome if you guys made a reply with ever sound looper you know and if we get a decent amount maybe we can create a new post with a list of them for everyone to use!</p></p>
