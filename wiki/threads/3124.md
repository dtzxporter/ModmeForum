<p><blockquote>Hey! I probably won&#39;t be doing the crossbow. Though, I might do it in a future update. Thanks!<br /></blockquote><br />Hey dude I think it&#39;s awesome you still port the weapons, can I ask what are you planning to do know? I think you&#39;ve done most weapons from the current cods. Also I pointed this out about 1/2 years ago but are you maybe thinking of ever doing fire start/loop/end sounds instead of the default fire sounds?</p>

At this point, what I’m gonna do is just touch ups on everything, do BO3/WaW/maybe CoD 4 weapons, and after all that, work on workshop mods. The start loop end sounds only apply for BO3 &amp; 4, but for BO4 weapons, I did just a single firing sound so, when you get double tap, the firing sound speeds up appropriately. Thanks!</p>

<p><blockquote>stop removing link of weapon packs ...<br /></blockquote><br />Hey! I&#39;ll have the MW 2019 weapons, and pack, up as soon as the touch ups/fixes that Tom and I are working on. However, for individual releases, I&#39;ll probably slowly roll those out once a weapon class is finished. I apologize for the inconvenience!</p>

<p><blockquote>you could just let us download the old releases.. i need mw weapons to release my map,and i can&#39;t import them myself since i don&#39;t own the game<br /></blockquote><br />If links are taken down that means the owner of the thread obviously had a reason to do so. In this case it looks like there were problems that needed to be addressed and he obviously didn&#39;t feel like it was good enough for public use, which you should respect.<br /><br />If you don&#39;t like it then go and port them yourself. Don&#39;t demand anything of anybody, ever. Period.<br /><br />Everybody that releases assets here does it to help people like you and you should have nothing but appreciation for the time we spend on them.</p>

<p>Hey dude, take the time. I&#39;m sure when you release it again it&#39;s gonna be great!<br />Do you think you&#39;ll ever consider porting wonder weapons from previous titles of cod? I mean, youre prob not a scripter. But I mean you never know may e you team up with someone haha. Also ever considered to look into melee weapons? Would be cool to see them all haha eventually.<br /><br />If you think about it almost every custom map includes your weapons from one of the games haha.<br />Keep up the good work my man your awesome!&#128170;</p>

<p><blockquote>BUT they were already good,no reason to completely remove them,example in the new terminal map..<br /></blockquote><br />It&#39;s his decission. No one should demand to do anything, if he feel like removing the links was needed then respect it. The weapons will come back, he just wants to upgrade them to be even better. meanwhile just wait, there&#39;s no hurry.</p>

<p>Hey guys, I&#39;m really struggling with getting the animations right when it has to apply to two different rigs. Someone must be better with these programs than me to figure out how to join the rigs together or a make the head stay where its supposed to during the animation?</p>

<p>Why do you allow only your friends to have access to these?  Why do you have to lie to all these people here?  Either you allow everyone else access or ill just rip them from one of your friend&#39;s maps and post them myself.</p>

But ripping the guns and reposting wont solve the problem, also demanding people is not okay.</p>

Plus, if I did upload them my self, there would be no way to tell.  Plus, its technically illegal to rip things from games like that anyway, so i know nobody can take me to court.  But they are selfish anyway.  Hell, half their weapons dont even pop heads or have sounds.</p>

There is ways we can tell that you reuploaded the weapons plus I bet you don’t have the knowledge to even know how to port a weapon. Weapons from cod are only illegal to rip if the weapon is used in another game if the devs themselves ripped it. Activision has never tried to shut the modding community down despite all of the weapon ports we have. They sued another company about a year ago because they used models from the Man-O-War and other weapons for their game.</p>
