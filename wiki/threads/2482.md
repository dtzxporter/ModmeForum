<p>Thread By: Abnormal202<br /><span style="color:#ebebeb;">First off, I&#39;d like to say that I normally don&#39;t ask for other people to test my map, I just release my map when I feel it is complete.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#ebebeb;">However, I&#39;ve put a lot of time (6 months at least) into this map, and I&#39;d like to have another pair of eyes look at it before I release.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="color:#ebebeb;">Basically your job would be to...</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#ebebeb;">1. Report any visual problems (basically if you find any ugly spots, report them)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#ebebeb;">2. Playtest it for balance issues (is it too hard or easy? is it fun?)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#ebebeb;">3. Report anything glitchy or broken (and maybe suggest ways to fix them)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#ebebeb;">4. Offer your opinion</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#ebebeb;">5. Suggest ways to make the map better (or ways to fix anything broken with it)</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="color:#ebebeb;">PM me if you want to test it, and I&#39;ll send you the link. Any questions with this post should go in the comments.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#ebebeb;">And before you say it, I am aware of a few issues such as:</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#ebebeb;">-There&#39;s only one mystery box and it can give you teddy bears (even though it will just respawn back where it was)</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#ebebeb;">-Sliding with Banana Colada doesn&#39;t always cause the yellow trail effect.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#ebebeb;"></span><br /><br /><span style="color:#ebebeb;">If you know a way to fix these issues (especially the mystery box one) you can post it in the comments.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="color:#ebebeb;">The map is based off the game, &quot;The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth&quot;, and is why it looks the way it does.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#ebebeb;">It also contains secret rooms (3 in total).</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="color:#ebebeb;">Anyone who test it and gives back a report will be given credit to on the map release page.</span></p>

<p>Reply By: PlutoBro<br />I am pretty sure you can fix the teddy coming up buy disabling the box moving in dlc3_code and zombiemode_weapons, although I am not entirely sure... Just look around for any thing set to true.<br /><br /><br /><br />Also in your mapname try setting:<br /><br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
level.DLC3.useChestMoves
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br /><br /><br />to false.</p>

<p>Reply By: Exofile<br />Neat! May I suggest, if you haven&#39;t thought of it, to use Modme&#39;s own Beta function. Makes it astoundingly easy to push out updates and control who has the Beta. :-)</p>

How does the Beta Function work?</p>

Just make sure to select Beta, and fill in the rest.<br /><br /><br /><br />When you want to edit your beta, say remove/add people to it, you do it in the creators hub on the homepage in the Modme Client.</p>
