<p>I already answered this for someone else on here. delete the json file, and clean all the xpaks. Make sure you have a thumbnail and description or it won&#39;t work.</p>

<p>How long are you leaving it ? If it&#39;s a big map it will take a long time to upload. The steam servers are terrible.</p>

This time the progress bar doens&#39;t have the numbers and it&#39;s only stuck like the image and I leave that way for about 2 hrs. So is stuck  &#128514;  &#128531;</p>

<p>It doesn’t “need” a image and description - but - if you give it one - the image “must” be a certain file type and under a certain limit...<br /><br />also deleting the json - means when he publishes again - it’ll create a “new” copy in the workshop - not update the previous one...</p>
