function powerup_remove_from_regular_drops( powerup_name )
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
From what I can tell, if as long as {% highlight php %}{% raw %}
zm_powerups
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
is specified as a {% highlight php %}{% raw %}
#using
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
in your gsc, you can do {% highlight php %}{% raw %}
zm_powerups::powerup_remove_from_regular_drops( powerup_name )
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}

 <br />Beware of {% highlight php %}{% raw %}

{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
. Although I haven&#39;t checked to verify this, I would not be surprised if fire sale is removed like this and is triggered to start spawning once the box gives the teddy bear for the first time.<br />Possible with {% highlight php %}{% raw %}
carpenter
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
too, but disabled/enabled based on whether 5+ barriers have been broken down.<br /> <br />I haven&#39;t investigated the csc side of this (if there is one).<br /> <br />Hope this helps.<br />&lt;em&gt;This won&#39;t help preventing powerups spawning from dig sites etc though most likely.&lt;/em&gt;</p>

<p><blockquote>didnt work for me, any other method to disable powerups?<br /></blockquote><br /><br />I’m assuming you want to disable drops completely? Like no drops anywhere at anytime throughout the entire map? If so, I have code that has worked for me, which I’ll send you as soon as possible. But I think it’ll only work if that’s what you’re looking for</p>

<p><blockquote>Thanks for your reply, but no i want to disable all drops except max ammo, this worked for me once in a previous map i made but now it doesnt for some reason its either that i didnt understand how to put the script or its not working anymore, but sure give me the script u have it would be appreciated<br /></blockquote><br /><br />level flag::clear( &quot;zombie_drop_powerups&quot; );<br /><br />Maybe replace &quot;zombie_drop_powerups&quot; with nuke or something and see if nukes spawn</p>
