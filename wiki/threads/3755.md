<p>You’ve got 2 of the same bone in the model so it fails to load the weapon “at all”<br /><br />Can only use unique bone names<br /><br />If you added the mag to the view model - that is incorrect <br /><br />You set it in the weapon file and it joins the 2</p>

I&#39;m going to go see it.<br /><br />So, i have just to create a magview and assimilate it in the wpn file.<br />Should I export my joints &quot;tag clip 1&quot; and &quot;tag clip 2&quot; with my two mags for the magview ? Because I use both for the two reload animations.</p>

<p><blockquote>you want the mag on the animated model and when exporting the anims<br /><br />After that you just want view / world gun models and view / world mag models and set all 4 in the weapon file<br /></blockquote><br /><br /><br />I just made the changes now. That&#39;s good.<br />It has converted the xanims files correctly, but I get this message : // 3DROPPED VERTS. 131 warnings encountered while processing xmodel &#39;viewmodel_safn49&#39;.<br /><br />The report shows me tons of mesh problems, vertex errors, texture stretching of all kinds... &quot;degenerated triangle&quot; wtf..<br /><br />I don&#39;t even know what it concretly refers to, when i check my 3d object.</p>

<p>Hi,<br /><br />It&#39;s ok, I was able to launch a game and test the weapon.<br /><br />It didn&#39;t really go as planned ahaha<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1216.jpg' | relative_url }}"><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1217.jpg' | relative_url }}"><br /><br />(ADS fire) I prefer to specify lol<br /><br />All anims, textures, are fucked up, normal map and glossiness are absent<br />For example the bolt is half animated, this enormous weapon moves so little.. things like that.<br />I don&#39;t know what&#39;s this viewhand too.<br /><br />I was more expecting this lol<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1218.gif' | relative_url }}"><br /><br />it must come from the weapon file and some animations which were badly exported.<br /><br />I have some questions<br /><br />1- How is it possible to manage the timing of the animations ? for fire, first raise for example, which are not registered in the wpn file.<br /><br />2- And for the viewhands, wpn distance, FOV etc.<br />i have the simple t7 rig, with which i made all my anims. Do I have to manage a parameter or set for the skeleton adapts to all bo3 base view hands ?<br />Which would explain why the weapon literally fly.<br />To adjust the weapon&#39;s placement in the field of view<br />I have to correct and re-export all my anims or can this also be managed in the APE?<br /><br />3- And in the end i&#39;ve to understand how to link the wpn sound aliases with the map.<br />All tutorial i&#39;ve seen seams illogic to me because, nothing in the zone file or the ape directly link the the sound aliases with the rest of the map script.<br /><br /><br />The last question below is hypothetical, it&#39;s far from a priority at the moment, but I&#39;m asking anyway.<br /><br />If I want a rumble camera during shootings or reloadings, should I export it as an animation with the actions in question ? Or is there an option to make it?<br /><br />That&#39;s a lot of questions i know, I&#39;ll be fixed after that !<br /><br /><br />Thank you by advance for help</p>

<p>The half bolt thing will be you’ve exported half the anim in maya<br /><br />State timers in the weapon file are what handle animation speeds, it’ll scale the time to whatever you set<br /><br />Ads up/down anims control where the rig is on your view<br /><br />Rumbles you can do with not tracks - look at 3arc ones, they say rmbnt# ( sndnt# plays a sound )<br /><br />Or you can manually set sounds, rumbles etc on the anim asset in ape and link it to a note or just set a frame<br /><br />The textures - make sure you are using the right material type, weapon_lit ( geometry ) will be suitable<br /><br />For sounds, if you use the useralias.csv it’s already linked to any map you make, or you can add / change it to another in the scz file ( you link csv there ) - just keep in mind your next map will still have all this in it</p>

I will take care of this SAFN today,  <br />I haven&#39;t figured out the speed of the shooting animation yet. To make them a little bit punchier.<br />The timer I tested sets the rate of fire, but I will find it.<br /><br />For now I&#39;ve been practicing setting up CW&#39;s weapons in the APE to get the hang of the thing. Reworking shooting animations, changing sounds, camos, set mags, accessories etc..</p>

<p><blockquote>Fire rate state timer is the speed it shoots<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Hi,<br /><br />I come back after having solved a lot of problems but one persists<br />Between the in-game rendering and the maya rendering.<br /><br />The problem is mainly the bolt, but the magazine and the hand are also sometimes affected.<br /><br />During the first raise animation, the bolt will be completely off-center and will return to its initial position at the end of the animation.<br />On absolutely all animations where the weapon is not in its &quot;vertical&quot; initial position I have a problem of decentring.<br />During the animations of running or crawling I have the same problem with the bolt going out of the weapon and same for the magazine that goes out of its position.<br /><br />I have tried absolutely everything to fix this, but nothing works. (The anim model, re-export all, set 0 values to tag_weapon init, re-binding the bolt joint )<br />The anims looks correct in maya, not in game. As long as there is an animation with the bolt or a movement animation, they are fucked up.</p>

<p><blockquote>untick “use bones” on the anims and make sure the weapon model is set to animated<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Yo,<br /><br />Both were already done.<br />I tried with &quot;use bone&quot; just in case of.., but the weapon is out of view, so I can&#39;t see if the decentering problem is fixed.<br /><br />What is strange is that during my first test exports, I didn&#39;t have this problem. <br />I&#39;ve just placed the weapon bone correctly in maya, re-exported all my anims with this new weapon view. And this problem has emerged</p>
