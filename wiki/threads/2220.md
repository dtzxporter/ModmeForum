<p>Thread By: SwanK<br />Sup peeps, its swank. I made that Spaceland Survival map a way back. Anyhoo I am working on a PUBG map that takes place in the Sosnovka Military Base and I am going to need some extra help on the scripting side. <br />I am fairly new to mod tools so I have only really gotten descent at the mapping side of things. Any one that wants to give a crack at helping with the functions I would like to include should send me a pm, I could use a partner in crime.<br /> <br />So that it is apparent that I am not making a garbage box map here are some images from what I have done so far. <br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/446854086827048961/452896144041836584/20180603140053_1.jpg"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/446854086827048961/452896174282637312/20180603140203_1.jpg"><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/446854086827048961/452896197619875850/20180603140229_1.jpg"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/446854086827048961/452896222475452428/20180603140319_1.jpg"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/446854086827048961/452896251122417664/20180603140500_1.jpg"></p>
