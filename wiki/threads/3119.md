<p>I have gotten custom weapons to work in the past, but that was on one map. All of the others have no sound and wallbuys don&#39;t work, can&#39;t get them out of the box, etc. I&#39;m currently making a Shipment remake with MW:R weapons. The weapons aren&#39;t buyable nor obtainable by box, but they work perfectly though. Can anyone help me with this? I&#39;ll credit you/mark you as a contributor if you want me to.</p>
