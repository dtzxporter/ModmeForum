<p>Thread By: ProRevenge<br />So ive been trying to figure out how to do my own wall chalks in the BO3 style but have been struggling with what sort of image and APE settings id need.<br /><br />Ive looked at the stock Bo3 chalks and they seem to use an image of a chalk texture and somehow &quot;overlay&quot; the shape of the gun over the top somehow, and have 2 images in APE to do this, but ive no idea how id go about recreating it for a custom gun.<br /><br />Anyone have any idea how id set APE and my images to get custom chalks as close to BO3&#39;s as possible? I&#39;m not after just a white outline set to effect, I want the real thing</p>

<p>Reply By: ProRevenge<br />That covers the main points, but it isn&#39;t what I&#39;m after, the chalk texture itself doesn&#39;t show, its still a solid white, look at the comparison between this method and BO3 chalks:<br /><br /><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/2137771b094eb7890b2b389e92c02e52.jpg"><br /><br /><br /><br />I ended up overlaying the chalk texture ontop of my hand drawn outline (I lack PS) and it still came out solid white, Ive no idea how this is done with the Bo3 chalks<br /><br />Its strange too, because in APE, each chalk&#39;s image preview shows the correct outline, but opening the image results in a solid fill of the chalk texture, like so:<br /><br /><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/12cc716eec984808d8eba613b890ed45.png"><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/20805ee122cc6b155bdf0525948af638.gif"><br /><br /><br /><br />Somehow they have the chalks working correct in the final texture though, no solid white fill, but looks proper as if it was drawn by a chalk and not painted on<br /><br />The BO3 chalks also have &quot;holes&quot; In them where you can still see the texture slightly behind them, Id like to get that with my chalks too</p>
