I also heard he was on vacation so he may not even know.</p>

Thanks&quot;   <br /> <br /> <br />they were also asking to share someone else&#39;s files even if the DL link was just broken they should wait for harry to fix it plus this is a really old post from sep last year</p>

But I didn&#39;t write that comment to help the sharing of files and I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.<br /> <br />Side note: I did read first comment, that&#39;s why I continued reading. An example of a healthy mind (Not saying you&#39;re unhealthy or anything of the sorts);<br />The topic&#39;s content didn&#39;t give what the topic title suggested. Instead of leaving the page, read rest of comments to ensure there is still no content. If anything, I&#39;d want to read the comments before it get&#39;s deleted, I may learn something.</p>

<p>Reply By: D-2-K<br />Yeah the Title of the thread is misleading this isn&#39;t for harry&#39;s perks it was for someone requesting a link to them</p>
