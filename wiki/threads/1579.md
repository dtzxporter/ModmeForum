<p>Thread By: Yen466<br />Hi,<br /><br /><br /><br />So I am very new to modding, however I have a very big idea, and along with it, I wanted to know if there is a way to add an intro cutscene. If so, that would be great, and could you please tell me how to do so, or link me to a tutorial for that.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks!</p>
