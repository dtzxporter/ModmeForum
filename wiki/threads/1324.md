<p>Thread By: TCM<br />I know this has probably been asked before but for some reason I am trying to use <br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
player PlayLocalSound("purchase_accept");
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />To play a sound, Really I just want to play a sound to the entire lobby when this easter egg for shooting perks to get a perk is done<br /> <br />I get an error saying player isn&#39;t recognized.</p>

That means anyone on the map hears it equally loud. Then you&#39;ll want to use a playsound function and play it anywhere (since it&#39;s not a 3D sound, location doesn&#39;t matter). There are a lot of sound playing functions in the <a href="http://aviacreations.com/modme/scriptdocs/">Modme Scriptdocs</a> that you could use. For example:<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
PlaySoundAtPosition("sound",(0,0,0));
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />This would play it at point (0,0,0) in your map but since it&#39;s a 2D sound it doesn&#39;t matter where it plays, everyone will hear it.</p>

PlaySoundAtPosition("mus_packapunch_sting",(self.origin));

 <br /> <br />EDIT: Did that with no luck of hearing the sound at all.. I just want it to play to everyone in the lobby.</p>

thread playwhenfinished();
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
function playwhenfinished()
{
players = getPlayers();

<p>Reply By: TCM<br />This is what I have right now doing that<br /> <br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
function step_completed()
{
	level thread playsoundwhenshot();
	if(level.perk_steps_comp &gt;= 7)
	{
		level thread playwhenfinished();
		thread ee_completed();
		
	}
}

function ee_completed()
{
	zm_powerups::specific_powerup_drop( "free_perk", level.perk_spawn.origin);
}

function playwhenfinished()
{
foreach(player in getPlayers())
{
	if ( isAlive( player ) )
	level PlaySoundToPlayer( "vox_invincible_song", player );
	player iprintlnbold("Test Finished");
	player zm_score::add_to_player_score(500);
}
}

function playsoundwhenshot()
{
foreach(player in getPlayers())
{
	if ( isAlive( player ) )
	level PlaySoundToPlayer( "vox_invincible_song", player );	
	player zm_score::add_to_player_score(75);
	player iprintlnbold("Test Has Been Shot");
}
}

{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
