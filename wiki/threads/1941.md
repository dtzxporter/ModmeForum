<p>Thread By: ZombieKid164<br />On my zombies map, which I&#39;ve been working on for almost 5 months, I&#39;ve gotten some problems recently. Now, when I spawn, zombies do not path to the player at all (some sit still, others play the walk anim but do not move) and some clips do not work, where you can walk right through them. The only thing I did before this started happening was verify my tool cache and Move the whole map up in radiant. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s causing or how to fix the issue, and I really don&#39;t want to lose this project which I&#39;ve worked for so long on. <br /> <br />Another issue I&#39;ve had for a while is when the player looks in certain directions, all lights being played off of fx dissapear (regular lights are still there). What&#39;s worse is that it is when you look different directions in different parts of the map.<br /> <br />Any help with either of these issues is greatly appreciated. <br />Thanks, <br />-ZombieKid164</p>
