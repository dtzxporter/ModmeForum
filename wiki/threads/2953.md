<p>Is there anyone who has spare time to get xmodels from Revelations for my W.I.P map? I&#39;m in no hurry to get them since it has a long ways to go before being finished, but I suck at porting xmodels and the person I asked last time is busy with school stuff like me lol. I&#39;m just looking for anything with a nightmarish vibe for right now (Like the Dark Tower pictured below).<br />Edit: I know y&#39;all see me begging for xmodels so thanks to all of you who put up with me! &#128514;<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.377.png' | relative_url }}"></p>
