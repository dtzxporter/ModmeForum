trigger_name waittil ("trigger", player);
while(1)
{
 Player PlayLoopSound( "slasher_saw_loop" );
}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
Or something similar to this.<br />Never edited the Brutus script, so i would make a new function with a trigger and put the trigger around the whole boss fight area.<br /> <br />But i think you need &quot;Player&quot; before &quot;PlayLoopSound&quot;.</p>

trigger_name waittil ("trigger", BOSS_NAME);

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />yeah you&#39;ll need to loop the sound on the boss, not the player. Also make sure the sound is a 3D sound in your alias, so it will sound louder when he gets closer.</p>

<p>Reply By: MJPW<br />Okay with your help I&#39;ve made a working solution.<br /> <br />In the &lt;em&gt;spawn_brutus&lt;/em&gt; function I put<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
brutus PlayLoopSound( "slasher_saw_loop" );
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />And it works! I didnt add in the Stop piece because it goes away on its own but it could be that when the boss is killed I animated his body to go far under the map because the original Brutus&#39; body stays dead on the ground but it doesnt look right with the Slasher boss with the way I have the anims set.</p>
