<p>Thread By: Quark<br />I want to use BO3 mod tools on my laptop,but I don&#39;t have enough space for the mod tools, so I would like to know if is possible to work on the mod tools while it is on an USB 3.0 external drive. If yes, what kind of performance loss will have?.</p>

<p>Reply By: Quark<br />Thanks for the help  D-2-K, I understand that upgrading the internal laptop storage would be better, but I also wanted to work on the my main computer without having to copy everything again.</p>
