Script: move_player
Author: CT8918 
Date Created: 3/9/2017
Move Function Help: DTZxPorter and EnCore Modding
Used initially in the map "Mortuus-Arena." Coming Soon...

Put in mapname.gsc (Located in Call of Duty Black Ops III\usermaps\mapname\scripts\zm)

My implementation was for moving the player on top of a moving zamboni.

HOW TO USE
1. 	Create Trigger with these two kvps:
		[Change Value] 		property: targetname 			value: name_your_function_trig (I used: ride_zamboni_trig) 
		[Add KVP]			property: target				value: point1
	
2. 	Create a script_origin where you want the player to start from with two kvps needed and one optional kvp:
		[Change Value] 		property: targetname 			value: point1
		[Add KVP Needed]	property: target				value: point2
		[Add KVP Optional]	property: model					value: c_t6_default_character_fb (This allows you to see where player will be.)
	
3. 	Create a script_origin where you want the player to end up with one kvp needed and one optional kvp:
		[Change Value] 		property: targetname 			value: point2
		[Add KVP Optional]	property: model					value: c_t6_default_character_fb (This allows you to see where player will be.)
	
4. 	Edit script below making sure the functions match each other. I have default names. 
		Use Ctrl+H to find and replace names. Find "name_your_function" and replace with whatever you want.
	
	Make sure to change:
		name_your_function_array = GetEntArray("name_your_function_trig", "targetname");
