<p>Thread By: xSanchez78<br />I know that there are attachment unique tables and I&#39;ve set one up for the reflex sight on the galil, but how would I include those in zone_source or how would I link them to the actual weapon file?</p>

HOWEVER, if you look at, say, the Banshii shotgun:</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p>{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
shotgun_energy,shotgun_energy_upgraded,,5000,shotgun,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,,FALSE,FALSE,shotgun,,,holo quickdraw stalker_shotgun

{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br /><br /><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">You can see at the end, the list of attachments is being shown. This may/may not work, but if you change the end parts of YOUR GUN&#39;s part of the .csv you might be able to add attachments.</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">Just make sure this is also in your map&#39;s zone file:</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;"></p>{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
stringtable,gamedata/weapons/zm/zm_levelcommon_weapons.csv

{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br /><br /><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">Hope this helps!</p></p>

<p>Reply By: xSanchez78<br /><p style="text-align:left;">That list at the end is a list of forced attachments, meaning you get them when you get the gun straight out of the box. Has nothing to do with setting them up in APE</p></p>
