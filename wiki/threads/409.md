<p>Thread By: Big Richard<br />I was working on a part of side project and when I went to compile and play the map the lighting was wired and looked blocky. It only happens in this portion of the map. Any help would be appreciated!<br /> <br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a/LyN9D" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

<p>Reply By: D-2-K<br />I&#39;ve been seeing this on most workshop maps even once or twice on official maps from Treyarch  right after i bought my gtx 1070 strix not sure if its a driver issue or an update from Trayarch that&#39;s done it but when i go into the graphics settings and disable ambient occlusion it fixes its self also had it on my map where i had a light outside hanging on a building and even with the shadows enabled on the light it still came through the wall causing this jagged shadow effect no matter what i tried to fix it even as Exofile said reducing sun shadow split distance or increasing it it didn&#39;t fix the issue in the end i just opted for a lamp-post further away from the wall and that seemed to work might just be a bug with lighting as i had reflection probe etc all set up even added a shadow cast which reduced the jagged edge a lot but didn&#39;t remove it completely was almost about to return my card at one point because i noticed it in official maps but i don&#39;t have issues with any other games that i play so for now i just test the map every time i add lighting i.e lights,probes etc to make sure its not happening</p>
