<p>Thread By: cadurling<br />Hey great mod manager you have here, since I have over 400 maps Modme comes in really handy.  Not sure if this could be implemented or not, but thought I would ask.  Would it be possible to add a tag to the thumbnail in modme to say the map has been completed?  I have finished so many maps and sometimes I can&#39;t remember just by the name of the map which ones I&#39;ve finished.  It would be really handy to just be able to tag the map after I complete it.  Anyways thanks again for making this awesome program.</p>

<p>Reply By: DTZxPorter<br />I was thinking of adding a tag like system where you could add your own custom tags to a mod, would make it easy to sort.</p>
