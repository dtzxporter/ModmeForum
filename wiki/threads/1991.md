<p>Thread By: XxRaPiDK3LLERxX<br />I&#39;m not sure what caused this as this never used to happen and it happened randomly out of nowhere...<br />Whenever I run this map (yes I do have the actor spawns and the script_struct with kvps) the round doesn&#39;t start, it&#39;ll just hide the remaining zombies counter and the round counter.<br />Did I do something wrong?<br />Thanks!<br /> <br />EDIT: Yikes, maybe I was wrong... the KVPs for the actor spawns were missing *facepalm*<br />Admins/Mods - You can close this topic.</p>
