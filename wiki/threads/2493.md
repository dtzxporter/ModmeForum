<p>Reply By: sethnorris<br />Hey! That would be great, I just finished an update for the map and I wanted to post it here. Also, do you have any sort of installation app or creator?</p>

Some of the mods have been converted to our new installer and are available &quot;Without the modme client&quot; I&#39;ve gone ahead and set the mod owner to you, so it will be ready. When I have some time, I&#39;ll send you a PM with info if you&#39;d like to get it up ASAP.</p>
