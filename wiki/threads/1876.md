<p>Thread By: Program115<br />I have some models from Black Ops 1 and appear textured in Radiant but not in-game. I&#39;m not sure what the problem is because models which I&#39;ve ported in the past have worked (and still work).</p>

<p>Reply By: Scobalula<br />You need to put the images into the IWD, which  can simply be done by going to images folder in raw, and copying them to your maps images folder and building IWD. There are also utilities that do it for you.<br /> <br />Also I&#39;m assuming WaW since in BO3 it should work once you put them into the map.</p>

It&#39;s worked before which is why I&#39;m confused</p>

<p>Reply By: DarkS0uls54<br />Look inside ape and make sure you image files for the material are set to best color compression let me know if that works</p>
