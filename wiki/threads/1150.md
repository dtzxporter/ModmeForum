<p>Thread By: Akrime<br />&lt;h1&gt;How to set multiple weapons as starting weapons&lt;/h1&gt;<br />&lt;hr&gt; <br />first of all, you need to know the code name for the weapons you want as your starting weapons. For example: the Man-o-War is called &quot;ar_damage&quot;.<br /> <br />If you have custom weapons, you have to write the same name you wrote in your map&#39;s zone file.<br />If you want to use the default BO3 weapons, here is a link to the list: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/54v8y1/weapon_name_list_for_command_console/">Link to the weapon code names</a><br /> <br />&lt;h2&gt;<strong>NOTICE: </strong>You have to CREDIT me (Akrime), if you&#39;re going to use this script.&lt;/h2&gt;<br /> <br />&lt;h2&gt;Steps&lt;/h2&gt;<br /> <br />&lt;h3&gt;<strong>Step 1</strong>&lt;/h3&gt;<br /> <br />Write this function at the bottom in your &quot;zm_YOURMAP.gsc&quot; file:<br /> <br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
function PickRandomStartingWeapon()
{
	// CREDITS: Akrime

	// Array of starting weapons
	listOfStartingWeapons = strTok("pistol_standard ar_standard sniper_fastbolt sniper_powerbolt ar_marksman lmg_heavy "," ");

	// Picking the starting weapon
	startingWeapon = array::random(listOfStartingWeapons);
	level.start_weapon = getWeapon(startingWeapon);
}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />In the line where it starts with &quot;listOfStartingWeapons&quot; you can replace the codenames for the weapons with your starting weapons as you wish. You can even add more weapons, but you have to seperate them with a blank space, just like in the code.<br /> <br />&lt;h3&gt;<strong>Step 2</strong>&lt;/h3&gt;<br />  <br />Right BELOW this line (same file)<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
zm_usermap::main();
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />Add this line:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
PickRandomStartingWeapon();
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />And that&#39;s it, you&#39;re done!<br /> <br />I hoped you liked my small tutorial!</p>
