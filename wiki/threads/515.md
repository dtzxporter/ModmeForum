<p>Thread By: BrandonTr3<br />Today i booted up radiant and went to edit the terrain in my map, and i noticed that i couldnt blend using the advanced patch editing tool anymore. I restarted my computer and height decided to work after, but blending still doesnt work. What could be stopping it from working? Any ideas?<br /> <br />EDIT: I have fixed it. The alpha color in the tab was white and not black like it shouldve been.</p>
