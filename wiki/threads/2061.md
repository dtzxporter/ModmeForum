<p>Thread By: Christians_Gaming<br />So my shadows from the sun volume are pixelated, it looks so ugly and can&#39;t hold out to look at it anymore! Does anyone have a fix?</p>

<p>Reply By: truman08<br />You need to select the sun volume and then lower the value of the shadow split distance. I would recommend changing it to somewhere between 250 and 500 but it will put a strain on your system when compiling if you set it too low (depending on the size and detail of your map).</p>
