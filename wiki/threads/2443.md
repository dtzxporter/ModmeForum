<p><blockquote>How do I make this louder?

I can not go any louder otherwise it would hurt my ears while shooting.</p>

<p>you can change the categorie which it is in, if the sound gets louder when you control the SFX then it&#39;s set on SFX I usally put it on Voice. But other then that you can also change the loudness of it in the sound file</p>

<p>The download only listed it to be 100% sound, but didn&#39;t group it so I think default it would put it under SFX, so you can change it. or change the gun sounds to be less loud</p>
