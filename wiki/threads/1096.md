<p>Thread By: Frost Iceforge<br />Is it possible to make it so pack a punching your gun twice will upgrade it again instead of just slapping on an AAT? Maybe by editing the zm_levelcommon_weapons (or your map&#39;s custom weapon list) and making a second upgraded weapon in APE?</p>

<p>Reply By: Oxford_Mann<br />I believe there was a post similar to this a fair while ago, where someone asked about doing elemental AK47s(pap to get random elements).<br />it was mentioned that it IS possible, yet it would require scripting to give a specific AK for the guy. In the IW Style Double PaP, it would require scripting, no doubt, as it is(as of right now) impossible to enter multiple upgrades to one weapon simply through the weaponstable.</p>
