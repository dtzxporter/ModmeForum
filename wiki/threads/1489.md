<p>Thread By: ProRevenge<br /><p style="text-align:left;">So how do I do the PAP camo properly for my ported weapons such that the camo changes to whatever people set it to in script, for example you add to a stock map, its The Giant camo, but someone adds it to their map thats set to Revelations camo, the gun will use Revelations camo,</p><p style="text-align:left;">Do I need a new model for the upgraded gun? do I need to change any materials or anything?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Also I only want one of my gun&#39;s 2 materials to change to the PAP camo, im sure thats possible?</p></p>
