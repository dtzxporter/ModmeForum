<p>Thread By: ActBadToThis<br />ok so i read the guide on the wiki and did everything same as the guide but at the bottom of test_weapons.csv i edited the line for the grav&#39; spikes and put TRUE for them to be in the box, but now my box shows weapons spinning but when its done it gives nothing, i saw another post on here with the same problem, when i tried his solution i got nothing so i thought id make my own post see if there is another fix</p>
