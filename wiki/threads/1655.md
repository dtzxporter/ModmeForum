<p>Thread By: The Black Death<br />I&#39;m fully aware that I can replace the magazine in Maya, but this is less efficient and uses more resources. So, via APE, how do I successfully setup an extended mags attachment for my pack a punched weapon? Additionally, the weapon in question is the AN-94, which has another magazine in the model. Both of these need to be extended mags.<br /> <br />Any ideas?</p>

<p>Reply By: The Black Death<br />Okay, using some hide tags sourcery, I&#39;ve gotten the clip used to animate on the viewmodel to be replaced with the ext mag. However, I still do not have a solution to get my extended mag working as a replacement to the standard clip. Any ideas?</p>
