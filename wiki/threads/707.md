<p>Reply By: PentaFrost<br />Hi Nate.<br /><br /><br /><br />Great powerup and thanks for making it public.<br /><br /><br /><br />ive been using this alone in my map, it worked perfect then.<br /><br /><br /><br />But now ive added all 6 of your public powerups. All the other 5 seems to show up occasionally but i never get the Zombie money anymore. Ive tested it over 200 rounds in total now. Still no zombie money. If i out comment the 5 other ones and let zombie money be the only one again, it works.<br /><br /><br /><br />Any idea if they interfere with one another on the zombie money drop?</p>

Maybe there is something weird going on after a certain number of drops have been added. I cant check atm as I am out of the state and dont have my scripts on my laptop. Here are some things to try to isolate the issue: <br /><br />- rearrange the order of the installed powerups in your mapname.gsc, if you put a different powerup where zombie money is then it might be the limit <br /><br />- try to remove a powerup and see if you can get it then, if this is the case you could remove carpenter from your powerups because screw that powerup lol<br /><br />I will look into a fix as soon as I can. I may call home to see if I can get a family member to upload my scripts to a cloud drive so I can take a look.</p>

I think it loads weapon first and then gets overwritten in money script.

I&#39;m not a good scripter so i can&#39;t really tell you how it works</p>

<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br />Alright so I took a look and indeed the register system for both Zombie Money and the Empty Perk Bottle powerups were the same as the Random Weapon registry. I updated the DL&#39;s so a simple reinstall of those 3 should fix the spawning issues. <br /><br /><br /><br />As far as the model not appearing, you may need to open the GDT at least once for the model to show. Each GDT is located in root&gt;model_export&gt;_NSZ&gt;_GDT. Open it in APE just so that it converts. Let me know if this all works out for you guys!</p>

I cant say for sure because I am not at my computer but I would find the name of the bonfire sale script and then include it as I have for my powerups in your mapname.gsc and your zone file </blockquote><br /><br />they gave us a bonfire script, but i tried that bonfire script before it does not work how it is stock, just makes it so map will not load with a error. i think he wants one because 3arcs does not work.</blockquote><br /><br />Oh man didnt realize that.

With other things going on nearby you almost not hear it.</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">Dont know if there is a way to make them louder, the cash one is a good volume :)</p></p>

<p>Could this be modified to make a drop/share points function or would there be an easier way of doing that?</p>
