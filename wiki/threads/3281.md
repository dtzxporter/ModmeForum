<p>Hi<br />I&#39;m trying to add the tools to maya but I can&#39;t. I&#39;m using <strong>Maya <strong>LT</strong> 2020 Version</strong><br />I&#39;m using downloading from here:<br /><a href="https://forum.modme.co/threads/cod-maya-tools-2-0-for-maya-2012.2452/">https://forum.modme.co/threads/cod-maya-tools-2-0-for-maya-2012.2452/</a><br /><br />The download only include this:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.754.png' | relative_url }}"><br /><br />And the instructions say that you need an updater.exe file that&#39;s not there (neither inside of the folders)<br /><br />I tried to do it without it and just adding everything in the script folder of my Maya version but when I try to run a .mel file this error come up:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.755.png' | relative_url }}"><br /><br />I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the maya version or maybe I&#39;m doing something wrong, but I really apreciate any help.</p>

You need to unpack the files to here: C:\Users\(yourusername\Documents\maya\2020\scripts<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.756.png' | relative_url }}"><br /><br />You will probably not have a usersetup.mel file, so just make a new text file in wordpad, and edit it so it looks like this:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.757.png' | relative_url }}"><br /><br />Save and exit.<br /><br />Now when you load Maya, it will do a first time setup.<br />I&#39;ve tried it on both Maya 2020 and 2020 LT.<br /><br />If you&#39;ve stuffed your installation altogether, you might need to go into regedit and delete any occurrences of it in the registry.</p>

I&#39;m using the 2.9</p>

The usersetup.mel file automatically runs on startup.<br />Probably what&#39;s happening for you now, is a consistent &quot;it&#39;s not working!&quot; which happens when you&#39;ve tried installing it the wrong way.<br /><br />Exit Maya altogether.<br />Run regedit from the start&gt;run function<br />navigate to here:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.759.png' | relative_url }}"><br />and delete the registry key.<br /><br />Follow my original instructions, and don&#39;t install from within Maya, and it SHOULD work.</p>
