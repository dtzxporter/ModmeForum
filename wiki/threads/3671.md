<p><blockquote>Oh really?

<p><blockquote>Harry perks be like:<br /></blockquote><br />Well everyone is always messaging me asking me for them so do the math<br /><br />Nice selective cut tho, clearly the point was - the tools were still new and MY errors were all fixed like a year ago - still got the developer logfile to prove it<br /><br />0 - script errors</p>

<p><blockquote>Bro you have alot of errors lol<br /></blockquote><br />What the actual hell is wrong with people nowadays.<br /><br />It feels like some people like yourself have some type of accelerated physical human growth, but have a significant brain development delay.<br /><br />In all seriousness, even if the assets that was or still are available publicly had errors, everybody makes mistakes. It&#39;s called *evolving*, everybody goes through with it. That is the only way people do not make mistakes in their work in the future, etc. Hence the reason why assets become updated overtime (if the author of the assets is available to update the assets, and such).</p>

<p>Especially as <br /><br />A - half the time we don’t know we missed a asset in the download - because it’s obviously not missing at our end - we need to be told and update it<br /><br />B - you lot constantly attack me - despite the fact I must be the only asshole out there who actually makes sure my shit runs on a base map - IN DEVELOPER MODE with 0 errors in the log - which I’m sorry but literally no one else bothers too meaning you can’t developer your own god damn maps for your OWN god damn errors<br /><br />C - even PAID EMPLOYEE DEVELOPERS royally fuck it up and you have to wait literally months for patches, Cold War was the buggiest atrocity going - which is why ppl literally exploit it into hell to advance or cheat<br /><br />D - half of you think things are wrong which are actually right because dick heads like icegrenade think vulture aid is meant to be broken and has spread it around like 15k viewers<br /><br />And most importantly e - there is NO WAY for us to account for other things installed on your map - there’s literally no fucking way we can ever know if it’s a conflict or a genuine issue - which has been the case at least twice when I’ve had this stupid backwards rumour spread that whatever I do is fucked<br /><br />Hell some of the dump tools you lot use I was the one they had testing the shit and checking that it works - as is - so obv I do know a thing or two<br /><br />Sigh, rant over, I realise it’ll never change, solely coz some malicious ppl spread rumours with such constant and consistent intent ppl don’t actually give a fuck if it’s true or not, then get all butt hurt when we take it down - then if we put it back UP they go on some kind of two month group attack until you take it back down again<br /><br />You can’t win, if you stop and remove yourself and your work - you’re a scum bag<br /><br />If you persist - and keep going and sharing - they chase you down, attack your sites, maliciously attack you / follow you / get and share your personal info ( like my address ) / make accounts to attack you and literally fucking stalk you till hopefully they get bored<br /><br />What’s worse is people praise the genuinely utter shit people like ice grenades work that are ACTUALLY fucked, full of errors that will literally break the map in developer mode or are dodgy work around with bad side effects when ACTUAL STUFF ALREADY EXISTED in the games code - coz we were 4 fucking games in by now, most features have been done during that you just need to open your eyes and actually find out how to add to / use or simply re-enable it<br /><br />It’s a game</p>

Lets set aside our ego and agree to disagree or jst stop fucking bitching, the fact that t7mods was taken down because of a mere argument is fuckin disgraceful and it really shows how fucking dense people are on the inside..... grow the fuck up.</p>

My discord is always going <br /><br />The HUD’s are done the old way coz back then we didn’t have lua<br /><br />Vulture aid is wrong in many many ways including instant invincibility when stepping on / off green mist which totally derps out the zombies <br /><br />Ammo drops will take your ammo away on dual wield or clip only weapons - instantly putting you down to 0 ammo and is pretty unavoidable<br /><br />9 of them are already in the tools, so he only actually did 4, one is weird coz there’s no d2p in bo3 and all the other 3 have serious issues<br /><br />The actual bo3 wonderfizz is also in the tools yet this uses some mega dodgy version of the bo2 one<br /><br />Who’s who will spawn you out of zone in locked areas - which will instantly kill you<br /><br />There’s so many back end errors that you will not be able to use developer mode with these - the game will crash on load<br /><br />Shit the lights are not even set up on them for god sake<br /><br />Tombstone and who’s who both fail to restore your specialist / grenades / tac grenades - and will lose certain guns <br /><br />Many more issues<br /><br />Waw was the same, only bams perks existed till I came along - and it again was a known fact how fucked they were<br /><br />If this is stuff you want go for it - it does not change that it is broken and/or incorrect - we simply listed alternatives and said what is wrong with them. If that hurts feelings then the owner of them feelings needs to man up ( the rest of us will continue doing things the correct way and properly fixing our issues out of our own free time so ingrates like you can call us names for our effort and get/use this work completely for free )<br /><br />Also food for thought - other people doing shit “incorrectly” is what drives “us” to do it “properly”</p>
