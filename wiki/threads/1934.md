<p>Reply By: ZombieKid164<br />Maybe, instead of asking other people for his weapons like they&#39;re some kind of black-market item, you should just ask him. He&#39;s a nice guy. I&#39;m sure if your map is any good he would supply you with what you need. The reason he took them down in the first place was because lots of people weren&#39;t crediting him. Giving them to people like this won&#39;t help anyone. Just ask him, he&#39;s on here and discord.</p>
