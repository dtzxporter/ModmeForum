<p>Thread By: Doodles<br />So, I have a vehicle in my map, but, even though he is a moving platform (so it should generate navmesh), zombie can&#39;t enter it or even get near to it when the player is on it, so I would like to know if can set something like a interest point, that calls zombies to a place when they don&#39;t know where to go.</p>
