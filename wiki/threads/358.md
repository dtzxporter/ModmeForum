<p>Thread By: soul-toktzt<br />Everything is white-ish, when i move my camera outside the reflection probe&#39;s area, even when i delete the probe and build lighting, anyone knows why this is? And maybe a possible fix?<br /> <br /> <br />Edit:<br /> <br /><a href="https://gyazo.com/1b3d6ba81c87ec008a75fe31d4fbc8e0">Inside reflection probe zone</a><br /> <br /><a href="https://gyazo.com/d262b9a00e10e09ab28cc35b581dea4b">Outside reflection probe zone</a></p>

You should have all of the playable area covered by reflection probes anyway. If that&#39;s annoying in radiant, you can use f7.</p>
