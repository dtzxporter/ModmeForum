<p>Thread By: And78Koz<br />Hi all!<br /><br /><br /><br />I&#39;m trying to export to Maya hands and man-o-war models with corresponding anims from BO3.<br /><br /><br /><br />I found, c_hro_player_male_armsdealer_viewhands (and others starting with c_hro_player...) are working with weapons xmodels and xanims.<br /><br /><br /><br />But I need those hands: <iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6g7cYeuKgEw" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br />Where to find them in assets loaded by Wraith?<br /><br /><br /><br />I&#39;ve tried to find them with multiplayer game mode and judging from textures those can be c_t7_mp_warrior_viewarms1_skin1, but Wraith exports only textures for viewarms (while viewlegs are exporting fine).</p>
