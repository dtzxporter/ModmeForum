<p>Been seeing map creators use peoples Steam ID&#39;s to grant them access to Secret Rooms for bonuses on the map and was wondering how this is done?</p>

<p>i doubt its possible to make it grab a steamID, but def possible with username:<br /><br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
self getName() == "Noot"
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br /><br />edit: a month later, hope you still waiting for notification</p>

I can use this to test for now tho so thank you :)</p>

<p>I’m not home so idk the right func but its something like getxuid() or playerxuid(). Look up xuid in the gsc html file in the docs folder. Tldr this returns a string of the hex value of the players steam id which you can also find on the internet. Note on the net it might be decimal not hex</p>
