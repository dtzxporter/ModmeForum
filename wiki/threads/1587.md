<p>Thread By: ZombieKid164<br />When I am in BO3 running my map, the game is jumpy even though it says its going 60 frames per second. I&#39;m not sure if this is the game or the map, because other maps work fine. But the issue makes the map pretty much unplayable. Does anyone know how to fix this? <br /><br /><br /><br />Edit: now happens on all maps when I used to be able to get 120 fps</p>
