<p>Thread By: AA191<br />Evening, <br /><br /><br /><br />I&#39;m trying to make my own weapon csv&#39;s for a new map. I&#39;ve modified a copy of the &quot;zm_levelcommon_weapons.csv&quot; to only include wunder weapons, and certain other weapons in the box. However, when I follow the tutorial on the wiki I get no weapons in the box. Help will be very much appreciated as I&#39;ve been dealing with this problem for two days now. Thank you to all who can help</p>
