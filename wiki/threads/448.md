<p>Reply By: Exofile<br />&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turn off KVP Box on Reflection Probe&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Start defining your boundaries by ALT+LEFT CLICK  on walls.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;As you define your boundaries you should see your 3d representation of the probe change. Once it&#39;s a complete shape, that meaning there are no open gaps it&#39;ll change in colour from it&#39;s white. That&#39;s when you know it&#39;s a viable probe.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ol&gt; <br />This is going by memory, might be a slight bit wrong. Find it easier to just do it than to remember the steps completely.</p>
