<p>Reply By: D-2-K<br />you can upload it to the workshop but keep it private/friends only those settings are on steam to upload it to the workshop all you have to do is select publish on radiant by selecting &quot;edit&quot; then &quot;publish&quot;</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />or you can send them the zone file from your usermap folder and tell them to put it in the same file path<br /> <br />when you compile, the ZONE folder is created, and thats what gets uploaded to steam when you publish</p>
