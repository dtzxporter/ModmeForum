<p>Thread By: CoDMoDs<br />Does anyone know how to fix this: when I load up my map and enter specific rooms, some of the models and textures disappear until I move to a different spot in the room. It really only happens inside closed rooms and I was able to fix it before by cutting a square in the wall for a window but I really don&#39;t want to do it for my other rooms that are having the same issue. I&#39;m baking the lighting properly and the rooms have their own reflection probes properly set up; I even set some textures and models to umbra targets which didn&#39;t help. Any thoughts?</p>
