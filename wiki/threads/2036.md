<p>Thread By: h00dedsn1per<br />Is there anyway to have a certain zombie type spawn in a certain area. For example one area / zone of the map might have Nazi zombies but when you enter a new zone or open up a certain area of the map another zombie type will begin to spawn e.g. moon zombies along side the original Nazi zombies. If that makes sense?</p>
