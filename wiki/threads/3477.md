<p>Hi all,<br /><br />I am a complete beginner and I have no clue what I am doing lol. I&#39;m watching tutorials now on youtube and learning that way but there&#39;s a lot of memorization. props to you pros out there who actually makes real maps. I watch people play them on their youtube channel and I am like damn, the creator of this map has serious talent. Anyway sorry for the rant. I am wondering why I am getting an error when I try to add prefabs. I watched a video and how they did it was right click go down to misc then prefabs and you should get a window to come up with a bunch of chaulk models, perks, etc that you can add to your map. When I try I get an error sound and when I hold the icon I see the window but as soon as I let go it goes away so I am unable to do it. I am not sure if this intentional or what but if there is a fix to this or another way let me know. <br /><br />Thanks,<br />Tony D.</p>
