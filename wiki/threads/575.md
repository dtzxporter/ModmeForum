<p>Thread By: Nytrofactor<br />I ported a weapon and want it to be used in mp/campaign/zombies without typing the /give command. I read through <a href="http://aviacreations.com/modme/wiki/Game%20Support/Call%20of%20Duty%20-%20Black%20Ops%203/Change%20starting%20weapon">this</a>, but it won&#39;t work because I&#39;m not doing it for a map, but for a mod, so there is no mapname.gsc. Is there any way to achieve this?</p>

<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br />You need to thread this function somewhere in your mod: <br /><br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
function new_start_weapon()
{
	level flag::wait_till( "all_players_connected" ); 
	players = GetPlayers(); 
	foreach( player in players )
	{
		old_gun = player GetCurrentWeapon(); 
		player TakeWeapon( old_gun ); 
		
		gun = GetWeapon( "bo2_sig556" ); // Change to your weapon file name
		player GiveWeapon( gun ); 
		player SwitchToWeapon( gun ); 
	}
}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br /><br /><br />It is kinda hard to guide you when you are doing a generic mod, so I hope you understand what you are doing. Drop a comment back if you are still lost</p>
