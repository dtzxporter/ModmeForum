<p>Hi everyone,<br /><br />I&#39;ve been working on a custom BO3 model for a while now, and I&#39;ve realized I need new BO3 models that are not included in the tools. However, I&#39;ve tried two links for downloading Wraith Archon and my PC flagged it as Ransomware, which obviously was very concerning for me.<br /><br />Does anyone have a safe link for the program that won&#39;t get flagged as ransomware? I know many people have used this software, but I don&#39;t want to download it if it&#39;s being flagged as Ransomware.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Aaron</p>
