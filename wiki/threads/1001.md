Treyarch broke something lately and it means edits to sound aliases/new sound aliases <strong>don&#39;t work. Full stop.</strong><br /> <br /><a href="http://modme.co/index.php?view=topic&tid=1310&page=1#lastpost">http://modme.co/index.php?view=topic&amp;tid=1310&amp;page=1#lastpost</a><br /> <br />I&#39;ve seen enough people having the problem that I&#39;m sure it&#39;s an issue Treyarch have caused.</p>
