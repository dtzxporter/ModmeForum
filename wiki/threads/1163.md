<p>Thread By: The Black Death<br />In my map I have a script_model with targetname &quot;aldwych_table_urn&quot;. Before a trigger is activated I want it to be playing a looping 3d sound, and after it&#39;ll play another sound (that won&#39;t loop).<br /> <br />To achieve this I&#39;ve tried to use the functions: <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
// to start the looping audio
&lt;entity&gt; PlayLoopSound(&lt;aliasname&gt;)

// to end the looping audio
&lt;entity&gt; StopLoopSound(&lt;aliasname&gt;)

// to play the one-time sound
&lt;entity&gt; PlaySound(&lt;aliasname&gt;)&lt;/aliasname&gt;&lt;/entity&gt;&lt;/aliasname&gt;&lt;/entity&gt;&lt;/aliasname&gt;&lt;/entity&gt;
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />(obviously not that code exactly, I have them set up with the script_model and the correct aliases.)<br /> <br />However, when in-game they are not playing the sounds.<br /> <br />Any ideas?</p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />This should work. Make sure that the alias is 3d, looping and loud enough.<br /> <br />Also add iprintlnbold(); to make sure that the script is actually running</p>

Also add iprintlnbold(); to make sure that the script is actually running  I&#39;ll double check everything :)</blockquote><br /> Okay, checked everything and found that the code is definitely running. Turned up the sounds to 90 volume and checked they were 3d, they still weren&#39;t playing.<br /> <br />these are the aliases I&#39;m trying to use:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
# after trigger is used:
activate,,,tbd_custom\zm_aldwych\quest_sfx\activate.wav,,,uin_mod,,,,,bus_fx,,,,,,90,90,50,700,701,,,,,3,oldest,,,1,1,,,,,,3d,wpn_all,,nonlooping,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

# looping sound before trigger is used:
amb_electro_magnet_left,,,tbd_custom\zm_aldwych\quest_sfx\amb_electro_magnet_left.wav,,,uin_mod,,,,,bus_fx,,,,,,90,90,50,300,450,,,,,3,oldest,,,1,1,,,,,,3d,wpn_all,,looping,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />And this is my code:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
function mainQuestline() {
	iprintlnbold("function called");
	ritualTableUrn = GetEnt("aldwych_table_urn", "targetname");
	ritualTableUrn PlayLoopSound("amb_electro_magnet_left");
	
	ritualTableTrigger = GetEnt("aldwych_table_communicate", "targetname");
	ritualTableTrigger SetHintString("Hold ^3&amp;&amp;1 ^7to Communicate with the Spirit");
	
	ritualTableTrigger waittill("trigger", player);
	iprintlnbold("trigger called");
	ritualTableUrn StopLoopSound("amb_electro_magnet_left");
	ritualTableUrn PlaySound("activate");
	ritualTableTrigger TriggerEnable(false);
	
	wait(5);
	players = getPlayers();
	for(i = 0; i &lt; players.size; i++) {
		players[i] PlayLocalSound("vox_antagonist_quest1");
	}
}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />the PlayLocalSound works fine. it&#39;s just amb_electro_magnet_left and activate.</p>

I would spawn a seperate model (like tag_origin) at the models origin then play the loop sound there, the. Delete  the model when you are done</p>

<p>Reply By: ZombieKid164<br />Sounds like it&#39;s something with either your alias or your sound. Make sure your file path is correct, your sound is 48000htz, etc.</p>

I&#39;m starting to think I&#39;ve hit that stupid 2000 alias limit again, so I&#39;ll clean out some unneeded aliases.</p>

I haven&#39;t hit the limit.<br /> <br />The sounds definitely should be fine - they&#39;re directly from zm_genesis and were pumped through Audacity to get them to wav.</p>

<p>Reply By: The Black Death<br />Turns out it didn&#39;t like the idea of playing a sound with the urn. To solve this, I created a script_struct with a targetname I could call in GSC, then spawned a model there, set it to tag_origin and played sounds with that. Thread can be closed now.<br /> <br />Thanks to everyone who helped :)</p>
