<p>I&#39;m making a weapons mod and I am attempting to change the starting weapons for the vanilla maps (nacht, verruckt, soe, etc). I know that if you want to change it for custom maps you use the .gsc file, but I am unsure how to get the .gsc file for the vanilla maps in order to modify them, or if that is even recommended approach and there is an alternative method.<br /><br />If someone could throw me a bone on how I could implement this I would be very grateful :)</p>
