<p>Thread By: Wild<br />Hello, so I have realized that in the starting room to my map one of the walls seems to glitch out the players vision. I don&#39;t understand why this happening since every other wall is fine. That&#39;s not the weird part though. The weird part is that every wall that works was copied from the one that&#39;s broke when I was building the room. I have tried re-texturing the brush. Re-doing all the detail on wall like the dirt and blood. I have even tried making sure the zone goes to the edge of the wall and all of this other stuff that wouldn&#39;t be related specifically to the wall its self, however nothing that I have tried seems to work. If any of you have any idea of how to fix this problem please let me know, Thank you! <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Here is quick video I made showing the wall that&#39;s broken and showing how all the other wall are fine.<br /><br /><br /><br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6jRVEm7FgMw" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
