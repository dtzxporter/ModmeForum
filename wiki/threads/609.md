<p>Thread By: Or_<br />Hello, scripting and porting always caught my attention and I thought that I want to learn it and do my own stuff like create/script new things/port old thing etc.<br /><br />I never did scripting/porting before and I think this is the time for me to learn.<br /><br />I want to learn but it&#39;s difficult to learn by myself alone so I thought if there is someone here that can contact me on Skype or something and give me a lessons of scripting/porting and how it works.</p>
