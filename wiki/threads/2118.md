<p>Thread By: tom5300<br />Hello,<br /> <br />I am having a strange issue where when I turn on the power on any map I am creating, there is lag (large fps drop for about 2-5 seconds).<br />I thought it was an issue with some custom scripts, so I did a clean install on another computer.<br />After the clean install, I made a new default zm mod level, compiled, light, and linked it. And still had the lag when flipping the power switch.<br />I have checked the console log and I am thinking it is an issue with setting the perk hint strings.<br />Here is the console entries from when the lag was happening:<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
Client: Registering configstring index 499 with data ZOMBIE_PERK_JUGGERNAUT2500
Client: Registering configstring index 3241 with data y&#180;k&#201;={

{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />I would get a wave of lag every time a configstring entry was written to the file.<br /> <br />If anyone has any ideas on how to fix this, please let me know!<br /> <br />Thanks</p>

<p>Reply By: modric<br />pretty sure this is on all custom maps good luck figuring it out</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />that part of the log is not to do with anything<br /> <br />thats not when the power was turned on - thats from _during the load screen_<br /><br />so thats happened before you even have control<br /> <br />the lag is caused by a huge amount of pointer functions being called in close succession from an array of variables and with network waits<br /><br />its also not all &quot;custom&quot; maps - its &quot;all maps&quot; - including stock</p>

I used the program SnakeTail to live view log entries as they are written to the log file. When I flip the power switch, those are the lines are written to the log file each time, along with the lag.<br />I thought it may be a coincidence, but after looping through a trigger array where I SetHintString(&quot;different text each iteration&quot;) on multiple trigs, I get the lag as well.<br />I&#39;ve seen that this lag is not limited to just turning on the power, but setting any hint strings that are not yet loaded into memory/recently registered.</p>

I posted a script in my Twitter, you can find it from there, covers what you need to fix the major lag <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="/modme/emoticons/cool.png"> Tested and confirmed to work by multiple people</p>
