(I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s like a death barrier similar to where the player go into a zone that isn&#39;t activated except this happens when you go out of bounds), again it should not be making contact with umbra volume nor it being more bigger than umbra_volume (All angles).<br /> <br />Then you can put any other volumes (BUT MAKE SURE THEY DON&#39;T GO THROUGH FPSTOOL60 OR DIE), I don&#39;t think it matters which order you put the volumes after you did the important ones.<br /> <br />Once done, compile link and light then check.<br /> <br />(FYI usually these mistakes happens if you&#39;re first time map maker, once you have enough experience in radiant, it should be hard to encounter this issue)</p>
