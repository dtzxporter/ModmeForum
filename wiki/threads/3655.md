<p>I&#39;ve looked through all the sounds on Greyhound and cant find any named sounds for any season 2 &amp; 3 weapons from Cold War. Is there a work around or do I have to manually go though all the unnamed sounds...?</p>

<p>You would have to go through each of them and see if you can recognize them, warzone has the same folly sounds as Cold War but the fire sounds are different since the sound works different in that game.</p>
