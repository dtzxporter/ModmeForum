<p>Reply By: modric<br />Ok I would use The Giant&#39;s vox. Would I have to use Wraith to grab those sounds or do I already have the filepath? Also where would I look in Wraith ingame to find the vox files</p>

You click loadfile and open zone\snd\all\zm_factory.en.<span style="color:#ff0000;">SABS</span><br /> <br />Then compare the filepath to the one in the zm_vox.csv file and change it using a replace tool.</p>
