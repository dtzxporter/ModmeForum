<p>Thread By: kingkenny<br />Hello!<br /><br />Let&#39;s say i have 4 walls in Radiant. How would i copy the Horizontal Shift, Vertical Stretch, Rotate, etc. from one wall to the other walls? Copying the first wall is not an option.<br />I wasn&#39;t able to find it out by myself and till now i always copied everything manually but I&#39;m sure there needs to be an easier way to do it.<br /><br />Thank you!</p>

<p>Reply By: Wild<br />Select the face that you want to texture, then middle mouse click the face that you want to copy. That will apply the texture and it&#39;s properties to the face you have selected.</p>
