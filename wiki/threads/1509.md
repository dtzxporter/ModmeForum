<p>Thread By: Abnormal202<br />I was wondering how you make a scrolling camo, like how Dark Matter is. I figured out how to make a material scroll, but I want it to have two layers, one that&#39;s scrolling one way, and one thats scrolling the other, or not scrolling at all. I&#39;m also not sure how you implement it as the Pack-A-Punch camo in game.</p>

I&#39;m pretty sure there is another way though, even if it involves overriding another camo (for example Dark Matter). I just don&#39;t know what it is.</p>

That&#39;s the only known way. + It also means that if you want a custom pap camo you&#39;ve gotta use <strong>no</strong> built-in mod tools weapons or you have to override the xmodels of the mod tool weapons in your map.</p>
