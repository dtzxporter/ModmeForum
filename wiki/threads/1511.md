<p>Thread By: Frost Iceforge<br />When I try to edit the bulletweapon file for my guns, I see stuff for movement speed, models, attachments, kick, recoil, state timers, animations, and all that good stuff, but none of the settings I can find clearly state that they adjust how much zoom a weapon has when ADS. The ADS settings are just F-Stop and kick and stuff.</p>
