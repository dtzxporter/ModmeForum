<p>Thread By: Wild<br />Hello, I have this problem now where when I try and bake the lighting in my map it says it failed and at the bottom of the window it says &quot;Sun FAILED needs more than 128mb&quot;. Whenever I try and compile the map it gives my error in launcher that says &quot;Error: Failed to export D:/Steam/steamapps/common/Call of Duty Black Ops III/\map_source\zm\zm_agc.map because Volume #0: 10.67, 512.00, -42.63     Level sun volume missing from file!&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />What I don&#39;t understand is that it used to work fine, then I worked on my map like normal and now it doesn&#39;t work. I still do have a sun volume and when I go to cords it says in the error there is nothing there. It says there&#39;s a volume there but the closest volume to that place is my start_zone but its not actually touching those cords.</p>

When I watch it while baking the light in radiant it goes up to 146mb and it says I have about 2.6gb available. I&#39;m sorry if if I didn&#39;t do that right. I&#39;m not very good with the technical side of making maps lol.</p>
