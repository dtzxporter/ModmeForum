<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Pretty good looking for a first map. One problem with it though, is that the space on the bottom is very open and wide. You don&#39;t find very open spaces like that on any official zombies maps because it makes it too easy to train zombies and avoid getting hit. You don&#39;t need to shorten the whole thing though, if you ever find yourself making wide open spaces you can just add debris and junk in the way so the players have to run around it, and it makes it feel more tight. I currently was dealing with this in my map, so I added some big machinery and drew clips around it, so it would be more challenging for the players. Good luck with mapping!</p></p>
