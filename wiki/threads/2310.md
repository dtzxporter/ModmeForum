But its truly up to you and what you&#39;ll actually enjoy doing, as long as you do that I&#39;m sure the port will be fantastic  :D</p>

<p>Reply By: truenightmare<br />if you can port either the Basilisk from black ops 3 or black ops 1 from zombies I would be very thankful, making a map which had it in and would love to add all the old weapons into it and can&#39;t find this weapon at all</p>
