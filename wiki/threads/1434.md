<p>Thread By: maxman5050<br />I downloaded Mathfag&#39;s bows and all that, when i downloaded the file i didn&#39;t get a folder that had scripts in it, specifically the #using scripts\zm\bows\_zm_weap_elemental_bow;. Now I&#39;m getting an error that says &quot;script not found&quot; which is obviously caused by the fact that the script is not in the game files lol. Did this happen to anyone else? If so does anyone know how to fix it?</p>

Last thing I can do for you is make sure you are downloading it from the right place: <a href="https://modme.co/index.php?view=topic&tid=2459">https://modme.co/index.php?view=topic&amp;tid=2459#</a></p>
