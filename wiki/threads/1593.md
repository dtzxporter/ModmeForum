<p>Thread By: mw3.<br />I have a weapon model and the animations I need from World at War and I have put the anims in the conversion rig and saw that everything looked ok (yes I changed the j_gun to tag_weapon). Then I set it up in Asset Property Editor and made sure it had the idle anim and fire anim (and the rest was the anims for the kuda), then I was testing it in-game and the gun was not there. I could see it normaly placed in the hands in third person. Btw the kuda&#39;s anims was working fine. If someone knows why this happens please let me know. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />##########<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>I fixed it by changing the anim type from delta to relative and made the weapon_weapnamehere_anim xmodel in maya.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzVSX-7scVY&t">JBird632&#39;s video</a> on how to do it!</strong></p>
