<p>Hey I really need to know how to make player models in bo3 mod tools, I can extract the character models in greyhound but I don’t know how to set them up to be playable. I hope some one can help me.</p>

<p>I think every game uses different joints than bo3, so you have to rig the models yourself in maya if you want them to work in bo3. If you are trying to use bo3 models, you can use this tutorial to learn how to add the custom player models. At the top it says it only works for mods, but one of the notes tells you how to do it without a mod. It&#39;s super simple.<br /><a href="https://wiki.zeroy.com/index.php?title=Call_of_Duty_bo3:_ZM_Player_Models_2">https://wiki.zeroy.com/index.php?title=Call_of_Duty_bo3:_ZM_Player_Models_2</a><br />forgot you&#39;ll probably want the first part too haha.<br /><a href="https://wiki.zeroy.com/index.php?title=Call_of_Duty_bo3:_ZM_Player_Models">https://wiki.zeroy.com/index.php?title=Call_of_Duty_bo3:_ZM_Player_Models</a></p>

<p><blockquote>those bones are not useless - you have to make them as “cosmetic” to be able to port it coz it’s over 255<br /></blockquote><br />they are useless. unless you are doing a treyarch-level playermodel, which isnt the case for 99,9999% of mappers</p>

<p><blockquote>they are useless. unless you are doing a treyarch-level playermodel, which isnt the case for 99,9999% of mappers<br /></blockquote><br />Wait so those bones are meant for eye movement and facial movements. If to imma try keep them. Thanks guys I know now what I must do…I’m sorry for that reference but right now sadly I can’t maya to work.</p>

<p>Yeah<br /><blockquote>For the sake of clicking one button - no they are important<br /><br />- completely static face looks awful<br /></blockquote><br />I agree it honestly just make the whole character ugly and dead. Also I hope I can get maya to work.</p>

<p><blockquote>What issue are you having with maya? what version do you have?<br /></blockquote><br />I had the 2020 light or Maya 2020 LT version and it wouldn&#39;t add the plugins and I had all the right plugins and added the script thing and it still wouldn&#39;t work... I emailed sg4y because he said he will help those who need like the full version of Maya.. but if you can help me that be lit too</p>

I wouldn&#39;t want to mislead you on that sorry.  With a quick google, it says custom plugins are not supported on maya lt.<br />Does Autodesk no longer allow &quot;students&quot; to get the full version of Maya for free for a few years? When I installed maya, all you needed was a .edu to get it for like 3 years.</p>

But if there is no video on it and I learn how to do it I will make my own video that way I and everyone else will know how to do it. But if there is a video that will be more awesome if you can send me it cuz I am not very good with reading instructions but videos works wonders for me..</p>

<p><blockquote>yeah because when you&#39;re playing zombie, the only thing you&#39;re looking at is your own fucking character?<br />harry moment<br /></blockquote><br />You do know some people have friends they game with right? They often meme around and have been known to look at each others player models. At least I hear that&#39;s a thing, I wouldn&#39;t know.<br />You don&#39;t have to be so rude man. I get that there&#39;s some bad blood that I don&#39;t know about, nor am I interested in the drama, so please don&#39;t fill me in.<br />However being rude out of nowhere, just breeds more hostility and hate on an already dying forum. No need to push more people away.<br /><br /><blockquote>No it’s good now I got a “working” one but I honestly don’t know how to use but I wish there was a video specifically for making custom player models, but since there’s not one I will have to watch various YouTube videos to know what I am doing- which will be very annoying and time consuming.

It&#39;s not nearly as hard as you think. You can learn everything except paining weights in just a few minutes. The hardest part is painting weights, but even it isn&#39;t super hard to understand. It just takes some messing around with to get the mesh moving properly with the joints without weird stretches. I&#39;ve never personally messed with rigging a face, so I don&#39;t know how difficult that is, but bodies are easy.<br />this is a pretty simple tutorial for painting weights i found.<br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fcl1fs7Bn_M" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br />it doesn&#39;t show the binding process, but that&#39;s easy. Line up the bo3 joints in your player model, click the joints you want to control the body, make sure the dropdown menu is on &quot;rigging&quot; and then click the tab &quot;skin&quot; then &quot;bind skin&quot;. You can click the little box by &quot;bind skin&quot; to make sure the &quot;bind to&quot; is set to selected joints. You can also play with other options, like the influences.</p>

I do commissions for character rigs on the side, so i can be of some sort of help along your way figuring the issue out, and i&#39;d be glad to give you pointers if need be.</p>

<p>Aayyy it’s good guys no need to have a conflict nekkrozrgfr it good that u think that no harm. And Harry I honestly don’t know what u did in the past and why people say stuff abou that but I agree with u, I like when the player is more alive in game, even though people might not look at it. So I like face with more bones but u two are right it doesn’t matter who likes face with more bones and how alive they look, it honestly is a big deal, and even if one of u wasn’t fighting as much or if u didn’t start it I honestly don’t care,- I don’t care as in it’s in the past so I am not dwelling on it or something. But both you have been a lot of hel, nekkro for example made me realize what the bones in the face do and Harry as given good advice to and no harm I just happen to agree with alive face in game. So sorry I wrot a whole essay but u guys are good no need to get angry at each other.</p>
