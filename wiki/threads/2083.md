<p>Thread By: Long Cut<br />Hey! So I have some weapon models that have a laser sight that comes with the weapon model itself. My question is, how do I split this off and make it into its own model so I can use it as a laser sight attachment later on? Do I need to create a custom joint in the new model and one on the weapon model that I use to bind them together with script? If that is the case, how would I go about that? I have been looking around for different tuts, but none (that I have found) show how to create a custom attachment with a custom model. I am a complete noob when it comes to this stuff so please be as detailed as possible when describing! lol<br /><br /><br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/iGId4Rl.png"></p>
