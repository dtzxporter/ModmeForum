<p>Hey, <br /><br />wondering if someone can help me setup an audio trigger so that when i enter a certain area a sound plays.<br />I have tried using IceGrenades tutorial as well as Wakkas tutorial but neither seem to be working if anyone can assist it would be greatly appreciated :)<br /><br />Sidenote: When attempting to use icegrenades tut/script, i can get everything setup however when in game, the text pops up saying &quot;music Activated&quot; and then instantly is followed by &quot;music over&quot;, not sure why as have followed it step by step and everything is exactly the same as what nade has done<br /><br />Wakkas: I just simply dont understand/seems more complicated to me?</p>

<p>Try this.<br />Create a trigger_multiple and change the KVPs<br />targetname = YourTriggerName<br />cursorhint = &quot;HINT_NOICON&quot;<br /><br />Open your mapname.gsc<br /><br />Underneath<br />zm_usermap::main();<br /><br />Paste this line:<br />level thread init_Triggers();<br /><br />Paste this at the end of map name.gsc<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
function init_Triggers()
{
    trigger1 = GetEnt("YourTriggerName","targetname");
    trigger1 thread trigger_play_sound("YourSoundAliasName", true); //true - Play sound to all players

    //trigger2 = GetEnt("YourTriggerName2", "targetname");
    //trigger2 thread trigger_play_sound("test_sound");
}

function trigger_play_sound(Soundname, AllPlayers)
{
    self waittill("trigger", player);

    if(isdefined(AllPlayers) &amp;&amp; AllPlayers)
    {
        self PlaySound(Soundname);
    }
    else
    {
        self PlaySoundToPlayer(Soundname, player);
    }
}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br />Compile &amp; Link your map and run</p>
