<p>I&#39;ve been thinking of what a great war custom zombies map would look like if done right. Kinda like a cool &quot;what if?&quot; map. It would be non canon of course but lore behind it to see where the story could have gone if we ever got one.  I thought maybe of trying to map a layout? There is little to go off of. Most likely a layout that kinda resembles origins a bit but without trenches. Of course you got the mound, tunnels, and crazy place but that&#39;s it. Would the map be better with bo3 style or bo4 style or a hybrid of both? IDK if anyone has talked about this already but I&#39;m surprised no one has tried to attempt making one.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been thinking about making a map like this for a while, mostly set in bunkers and nacht/verruct-style buildings, with a black and white filter over everything.</p>
