If so, select your zombie spawn struct and in the KVPs make sure &quot;script_string&quot; has the same value as the targetname that the barricade has. If the zombie spawn is inside the map then make sure the script_string is set to &quot;find_flesh&quot;. If all of that is set up correctly then make sure you zones + adjacent zones are all set up correctly. If all of that is all set up correctly but it still doesn&#39;t work then I&#39;m not sure :(</p>

<p>Reply By: CR4keur<br />Hey thank you for your reply but the zombies were working since I touched something with the floor, it was a terain patch and now they are not attired at all I did not touch the properties of the spawners so I don&#39;t think this is the problem :/</p>

Or was it already a patch but you touched something else? Could you explain everything that you did from the time they did work to the time they stopped? Thanks :)</p>

<p>Reply By: soul-toktzt<br />You could try placing a pathnode above the ground. Not sure if that will work but it&#39;s worth a try.</p>

I guess try what they said and use nodes but to be honest I am not sure how to use those in the BO3 engine.</p>
