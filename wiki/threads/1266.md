<p>Thread By: mathfag<br />Can someone please explain the damage callback function (not even sure it that&#39;s what it&#39;s called). Basically I&#39;d like a function that does something when an ai gets shot or dies, like was it a headshot, torso shot, mustang and sally kill...<br />Also where in the script would I add it.<br /> <br /> <br />3 gold stars to whoever responds <strong>usefully</strong> :)<br /> <br />Disclaimer: Gold stars may be digital images from google</p>

 <br /> <br />add the function you pass to an array, when a zombie takes damage, it runs every single call back in the array, until one returns true, if none returns true, it continues the normal damage behavior<br /> <br />if one returns true, it performs whatever was in that callback - and abandons the rest of the &quot;normal&quot; zombie takes damage behavior<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
function function_we_passed( str_mod, str_hit_location, v_hit_origin, e_player, n_amount, w_weapon, direction_vec, tagName, modelName, partName, dFlags, inflictor, chargeLevel )
{
	// self == zombie
	// e_player == player or entity that dealt the damage
	if ( w_weapon.name == "a weapon of our choice" )
	{
		do_stuff();
		return true;
	}
	else
	{
		// wasnt hit by my gun or under the conditions i want to change what happens when damaged
		return false;
	}
}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />tag_name will return the closest tag to what was hit, v_hit_origin will return the exact origin of impact, if you wanna run special behavior - and still allow the regular behavior to happen, return false after your logic instead of true<br /> <br />theres a death call back too, damage call backs wont happen if they die, the death one does instead<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
zm_spawner::register_zombie_death_event_callback( &amp;function_to_run );
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />and to run a function on ai when they spawn in ( for setting crap up if needed )<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
zm_spawner::add_custom_zombie_spawn_logic( &amp;function_to_run );
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br /> <br />check where these functions get called in zm_spawner if you need to see what arguments are being passed to them</p>
