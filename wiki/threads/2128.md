<p>Thread By: Zixology<br />So... Who do I need to talk to about getting some certain player models ported/rigged? I suck at it and need to work on the mapping, making textures, and some of the scripting so I don&#39;t exactly have the time either.<br />Obviously whoever helps out will get credit (that shouldn&#39;t even need to be said). But I&#39;ll even pay for it. This is a very important project.</p>

<p>Reply By: Zixology<br /><blockquote><em>ShadowilyI</em><br />which one do you need ?</blockquote><br /> I need 4 player models from Modern Warfare Remastered. As long as someone knows how to properly rig them and convert them for use in BO3, I&#39;m fine with buying MWR and getting the assets from the game for you.</p>
