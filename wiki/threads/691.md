<p>Thread By: AA191<br />I need help with a script when you knife or shoot the perk machines they play their Jingles :x<br /><br />My easter egg has hints in the jingles that can be heard, and I need to get them to play on command somehow. Help would be much appreciated :3</p>

<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br />You can do a trigger_damage and then waittil(&quot;trigger&quot;, player); then playsoundatposition(trigger.origin); <br /><br /><br /><br />That is nothing usable by itself but it should hopefully get you started on how to implement. I imagine you have more you would like to do than simply just play the perk jingles so I suggest looking at someone&#39;s shootable trig tutorial and basing your code off of that.</p>
