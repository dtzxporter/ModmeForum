<p>Thread By: NINJAMAN829<br />Hey guys, in this topic, I&#39;ll occasionally be releasing gun ports that I&#39;ll be porting in my free time.<br /><br />The ports will mainly consist of Bo3 DLC guns and bo3 guns not in zombies. I&#39;ll probably not port guns that are already done unless I feel I should.<br /><br />NOTES: Each download will have individual instructions for installing the weapon. Some may even include a wallbuy. (I might update existing ports with them when I get around to it.)<br /><br />Now let&#39;s get down to business.<br /><br />WEAPONS:<br /><br />Black Ops 3:<br /><br />
Snipers:<br /><br />
Dragoon V1.0.2<br /><a href="https://mega.nz/#!6UgVxK4L!uyOa9CRGxW1RKRd0ET7M8l5tvrH35Uabxn6peRSMxXI">Download</a>
<br /><br />
<br /><br />ALSO: Be sure to credit everyone I have listed in the readme&#39;s, the put in a good amount of work to help make these ports possible.</p>

<p>Reply By: Ping998<br />Nice Dragoon port! Would you be able to port the M14 from BO3? I know harry is releasing it eventually but I&#39;d rather have a specific single download for it if that&#39;s possible.<br /> <br />Thank you,<br /> <br />- Ping</p>
