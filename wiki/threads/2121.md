<p>Thread By: kingkenny<br />Hi,<br /><br />I&#39;ll maybe produce some Round Sound-Packs (100% selfmade and royalty-free) including First Intro , Round Start/End, Dog Round Start/End, Game Over etc. -sounds.<br />I&#39;d upload the sounds in the correct format and with a text file containing the aliases.<br /><br />But first of all,<br />Is anyone even interested in something like this?<br />And if yes, where should i post it then? &quot;Public Assets&quot;?</p>

But I think I&#39;m not the only one that thinks that, also I think you can just upload it in the public assets if you are planning on making and also uploading these sounds for everyone, just make sure to include a tutorial for installing/changing the round music.<br /> <br />Other then that I think it would be awesome to have something like this!<br />So I would say go for it.</p>

Not round music that is already made by treyarch/infinity ward/sledgehammer.<br /> <br />You can find those sounds from moon remasterd and others in videos and you could donwload them and make them yourself.</p>
