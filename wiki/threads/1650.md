<p>Reply By: tjlazor935<br />Someones ported the MG42 from PD2 its just broken at the moment, so I know it&#39;s very much possible to do, would be cool to get the legendary skinned guns over aswell as a PAP&#39;ed version for the gun</p>

<p>Reply By: Collie<br />It&#39;s actually something I&#39;ve wanted as well. If someone figures out a way to extract anims and models into a format usable in maya 2016 I&#39;d be more than happy to make a conversion rig for the animations &amp; post it here.</p>
