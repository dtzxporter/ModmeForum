<p>Reply By: The Black Death<br /><blockquote><em>mathfag</em><br />You may need to make some materials for the fx</blockquote><br /> In addition to this, the <strong>*first*</strong> time you put it into Radiant, the Output Log will tell you what&#39;s missing. After it has been first added it <strong>will not work </strong>as Radiant will have already &quot;edited&quot; the efx.</p>
