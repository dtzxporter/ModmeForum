<p>Hey guys, I&#39;m looking for someone to help me out with custom weapons for my &quot;movie themed&quot; medieval map. I&#39;m mainly looking for themed melee weapons and a bow&#39;n&#39;arrow to use (not the DE bow) for quality map immersion. I am more than happy to pay anyone for their time and can negotiate prices. Thank you for your time</p>

<p>I am working on making Kratos&#39; Leviathan Axe from God of War, it could also double as Stormbreaker with different UVs. It will be an off hand weapon like the Hell&#39;s Retriever, I will probably try to make it a main hand weapon as well to work like the hatchet. There is a post I made it&#39;s the post just above yours titled Need Help. with information about the weapon and a screen shot, it also has all the raw files I&#39;m working with. It&#39;s not a working weapon yet. should hopefully be finished by tomorrow and avaliable to download. I don&#39;t need credit for it if you use it, I do it just for the fun of it. Also I am modeling another melee weapon The First Blade, that will be a little while I have to make it from scratch.</p>
