<p>Thread By: SwanK<br />Would someone be able to help me with this concept I have for dog rounds?<br />The idea is that during a dog round, player clips and fire would appear in certain door ways blocking players from moving room to room during a dog round, whilst the dogs can move freely because it is only a player clip.</p>

Then Show() them when a dog round starts. For the fire, you could use a Treyarch fire FX and play it on all the doorways.</p>
