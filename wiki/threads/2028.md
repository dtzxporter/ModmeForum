<p>Thread By: PowerD7<br />Anytime I try to create a map and then compile/link it, Black Ops III crashes and says &quot;blackops3.exe has stopped working&quot;. If you know anything on how to fix this, any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>Reply By: Tjmoney030589<br />Did you check the integrity of your game files through Steam? Just a thought I&#39;ve only been doing this for a few months so I&#39;m still learning but I had to do that the other day. Hope it helps :)</p>
