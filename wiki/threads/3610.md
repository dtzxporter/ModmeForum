<p>so ive got multiple trigger_multiple&#39;s set up to teleport the player to specific locations depending on different things. Is there a way the zombies can follow them through the trigger multiple? or would it be more effective to just kill of the zombies in that area?<br /><br />thanks for any help in advance</p>
