<p>Thread By: MrNoobington<br />Hi. Was just wondering how I&#39;d spawn an fx at the end of a bullettrace. Eg) The player shoots the floor and an fx is spawned where the shot hits. I&#39;ve looked through the bo3 gsc files but can&#39;t find anything exact. I also somehow mess up when attempting bullettraces.<br />This is what I have currently: <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
trace = bulletTrace( self getEye(), self getOrigin() - ( 0, 0, 60 ), false, self );
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
final.origin = trace["position"];
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
SpawnFX("skull_weapon_zombie_mist", final.origin);
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
self IPrintLnBold(final.origin);
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />Also wondering how I&#39;d add gravity to the shot (similarly to the kt4). Would I just put a range limit on the bullettrace and work out how to drop the coords to the ground?<br /> <br />Thanks in advance.</p>

Theres no need<br /> <br />The kt4 for example doesnt fire bullets, its projectiles, which you can get the impact location from, as for &quot;gravity&quot; as you put it - thats all weapon file settings</p>
