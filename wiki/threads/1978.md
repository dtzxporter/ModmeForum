<p>Thread By: Noah Gamerscore<br />So I have a song/sound that I would like to add into the map when you actually load up into the map, Like after the black screen goes away. If there is anyway that this is possible that would be awesome and would greatly appreciate it. Thank you for taking your time by looking and responding to my request.</p>
