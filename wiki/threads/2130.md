<p>Thread By: kingkenny<br />Hello,<br /><br />I have a map where I did include around 24 custom weapons. That worked fine on that and other maps.<br />Now i wanted to add more custom weapons and I&#39;ve used &quot;Skye&#39;s Weapon Ports&quot; and some other Weapon Packs from the &quot;Weapon Ports MEGATHREAD&quot;.<br />I included everything into my zone, sound aliases and zm_levelcommon_weapons files and drag and dropped the asset folders into my BO3-folder. (model_export,xanim_export,sound_assets,...).<br />The game crashes now always at the loading screen/video. <br />Here is my console_mp.log : <a href="https://pastebin.com/6QzNJ9Cc">https://pastebin.com/6QzNJ9Cc</a><br /><br />I&#39;m pretty sure this is pretty easy to solve but I can&#39;t find the problem in the log.<br /><br />If you need more info, feel free to ask.<br /><br />Thank you for any help!</p>

<p>Reply By: kingkenny<br />Ok i think i found the problem.<br />It looks like there is a limit of how many weapons i can add. As soon as i&#39;ve added more than 309 &quot;weapon,...&quot; lines to the zone file i run into this problem. <br /><br />I may be wrong but I&#39;m still testing around.</p>
