<p>That&#39;s brilliant. Will be a welcomed item to a lot of maps I am sure. Especially ones that are quite good to look at in the start. Or even as something slightly hidden to start the game. <br /><br />Good work.</p>

<p><blockquote>If i make it a shootable trigger with the same target name would that work also?<br /></blockquote><br />Yo I am Xspicious, I re-branded so my name is different now. Yes you can use pretty much any trigger you want. I have changed the script just a tiny bit. The setup for the script is exactly the same as I said above, but in Radiant if you want a model to delete once you press it. Make a script_model or a script_brushmodel and then select the trigger FIRST then select the model/brushmodel and press W. That is all for Radiant. Also if you know how to make game objects move or something like that could could change e_model Delete(); in the script to what ever you would want it to do. So I guess who ever reads the comments will get the better version lol<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
function startGame(){

    e_trig = GetEnt( "start_game_trigger", "targetname" );
    e_model = GetEnt( self.tartget, "targetname" );
    e_trig SetCursorHint( "HINT_NOICON" );
    e_trig UseTriggerRequireLookAt();
    e_trig SetHintString( "Press ^3[{+activate}]^7 to activate" ); // Edit this to whatever you want inside of the " "

    player = GetPlayers();
    for( i = 0; i &lt; player.size; i++ ){
      
        player[i] PlayLoopSound( "zmb_bgb_nysm_loop" ); // must comment if you are not using a looping sound. Could also change it to  PlayLocalSound for a nonlooping sounds.
        e_trig waittill( "trigger" );
        player[i] StopLoopSound(); // must comment if you are not using a looping sound
        e_trig PlaySound( "zmb_bgb_round_robbin" );
    } 
    e_model Delete(); // comment this line if you don&#39;t want the model to delete.
    e_trig Delete();
}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br />Also you can use a trigger_multiple and set script_trigger_allplayers to true -  then once all players touch it at the same time it will activate.</p>

That sounds like a good idea. Yeah a model that disappears would be ideal. That way, there isn&#39;t something left in the way. And all players being there to trigger would also work.</p>

<p>Just to double check I use the original function and add the other one also.</p>

<p>No just use the new function I posted and add this to your main function as the first line {% highlight php %}{% raw %}
level.round_prestart_func= &amp;startGame;
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
</p>
