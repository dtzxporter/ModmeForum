 Use this as a &quot;flag&quot; I guess you could say, just pointing you towards the right direction.</p>

<p>Reply By: billdavison<br />I whipped something quickly I tested it it works, in the comments I tried explaning  it the best I could but it works and there are things that need to be modified so your door moves where you want it but remember to  thread setting_up_the_door(); in your main function I hopped this helped<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
// make sure you thread setting_up_the_door(); in the main function in your mapname.gsc

// this is for somthing
function  setting_up_the_door()
{

 
//fyi the word level used in scripts means i can use that variable in any functions fyi
//this is setting the targetname of the trigger_use in radiant as door_trig
 level.door_trig = GetEnt("door_trig", "targetname");
 level.door_trig SetCursorHint("HINT_NOICON");
 level.door_trig UseTriggerRequireLookAt();
 level.door_trig SetHintString("this door will open after round 3"); //type what ever your heart desires anything around these lines or this door will magically open lol i dk/ this is what the door says
// now you need to set up the script_model&#39;s targetname  to door_model1 in radiant

 level.door_model1 = GetEnt("door_model1", "targetname");
 level.door_model1 SetCursorHint("HINT_NOICON");
 level.door_model1 UseTriggerRequireLookAt();
 
 // this sets up a second door,now you need to set up a second  script_model&#39;s targetname  to door_model2 in radiant
 
 level.door_model2 = GetEnt("door_model2", "targetname");
 level.door_model2 SetCursorHint("HINT_NOICON");
 level.door_model2 UseTriggerRequireLookAt();





while(1)
 {

if (level.round_number == 3)
   {

	thread openthedoors();
	break;
	wait (.01);
   }
    wait(.01);

 }



}


function openthedoors() 

{
 level.door_trig Delete();
 level.door_model1 MoveY(-100,6); // change the x to  y or z if you want the door to move in a different direction , do some playing around to figure out where you want to move your doors to move
 level.door_model2 MoveY(56,6);
 
}

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />when deleting a barrier you need to use<br /><br /><br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
entity connectPaths();
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />on it first before deleting it or zombies will not path ( also tick dynamic paths of the entity in the kvps in radiant )<br /> <br />also if it leads into another zone, you also need to set the flag for that zone so it activates<br /> <br /> <br />also, the shortest possible wait in gsc is 0.05 not 0.01 ( 0.01 is the shortest possible wait in csc however )</p>

<p>Reply By: noVADex<br />Thanks guys this was all very helpful, never had any issues with zombie pathing after deleting the entities, but i did use a multi trigger with touch zone activation on the other side of the clip/brush. <br />Cheers</p>

I am stating facts -the pathing works, so that info isn&#39;t helpful at this time.

I&#39;ve always only used the kvp on a trigger. Although i have attempted to use what i know from waw and also what i can figure out from the code ive seen. Yes, it makes it past the linker, but doesn&#39;t work in game or causes a error during loading. Knowing that line of code for activating a zone would actually be very helpful, and im sure many wouldn&#39;t argue that point.<br />Thanks again</p>

I am actually testing and using the code, obviously your not. Even the original answer of script from billdavison works and has correct pathing, again i tested it too.You would know this if you tried them. No i did not attempt any zone activation during those original tests.<br />again i say, thank you for your great effort.</p>
