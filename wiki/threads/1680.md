<p>Thread By: Psh<br />As the title suggests, if anyone could lend me a hand by porting one of the Modern Warfare Juggernaut models to be compatible with Brutus anims that would be much appreciated. I like to believe MW3 had the proper Juggernaut models but I&#39;m not too sure. Don&#39;t feel Brutus fits the theme of my new map but changing him to a Juggernaut with different sounds might make more sense.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Map for anyone one interested.<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/PnsO0rc.jpg"></p>
