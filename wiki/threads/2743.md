<p>Hello, so I have been porting some weapons and have never encountered this.<br />I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s because I don&#39;t have the weaponfile setup properly for a tactical weapon. If anyone knows the proper way, I&#39;d love a nudge in the right direction.<br /><br /><a href="https://gyazo.com/29e6f12c825f7a9e984561100b167840">This is what it looks like.</a><br /><br />Just in case anyone sees it, I know I&#39;m using a view model as a world model, I will be changing that later:p<br />All the other animations play just fine, except reload and reload empty.<br />I&#39;m at a loss and figured someone would know what I did wrong.<br /><br /><br />Things I&#39;ve tried.<br /><br />Using the normal reloads instead of tactical reloads.<br /><br />Renamed joints to match the bo3 counterparts in both the models and reload anims.<br /><br />I triple checked the vm and anim model both had tag_weapon.<br /><br />I have exported it multiple times, including changing the tag_weapon before exporting.<br /><br />Double checked that the reload anims were correct in the weapon file.<br /><br />Here are a few images that might be useful?<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.150.png' | relative_url }}"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.151.png' | relative_url }}"><br /><br />If any one knows what is wrong I&#39;d love some help! If you need any other info I can let you know what you need. Thank you for your time.</p>
