<p>I&#39;m having this issue where some models and brushes are simply not even showing up or popping in and out of map. I&#39;ve had this issue before (never on this scale) although I forgot exactly how I fixed it. I believe it had to do with how my skybox was placed on my map, but I tried that and to no avail.<br /><br />Here&#39;s a vid of what&#39;s happening: <iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4nhl25zavDI" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

<p><blockquote>umbra problems, plus i cannot see the video, link does not work<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Came back to this map after a while and still not sure why it won;t work. Checked the umbra volume and didn&#39;t see any problems. Might just copy and paste everything into a new map and see if that fixes things at this point.</p>
