<p>Thread By: SpeedBeam<br /><p style="text-align:left;">I know what you are thinking, yes. I&#39;m having issues with World at War mod tools. And NO, you CANNOT tell me to download them again. I have wasted 5 hours downloading and installing the WaW mod tools, and yet I have missing files. Sounds folder, which is missing a few files which I have NO clue on how to fix it. 1.0 has none of those missing folders that I need, 1.1 has nothing on what I need, 1.2 has none yet, 1.3 and 1.4 is the same result. Also, dog_init error which why I have no clue on how to fix it. Ugh, I had so many troubles with World at War before that this is going really horrible. I hope someone comes across this post and sees that I&#39;m having issues with this. And no, no UGX patches to fix this. I will wait to install it if I have no other choice but to do that.</p></p>
