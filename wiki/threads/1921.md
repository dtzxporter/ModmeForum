<p>Thread By: Tuxos<br />Hello there,<br /> <br />I just started to make a map for me and my buddies to fu**k around and have fun on.  As i progressed on  Building and Layouting my map<br />I realized that ( at least for my first map ever ) it looks pretty damn good visually and decided to release it eventually.<br />But I have a problem,  I have no Idea how scripting stuff works, the closest i got to scripting was pasting in some lines in the gsc etc. for <br />additional Perks and Weapons. I already have some Ideas for smaller EEs and such but no Idea how to execute them. Also Traps, sounds, ( maybe zones, but I think I can manage those ).<br />So, If anyone is interested in helping me make this map a masterpiece (slightly exaggerated description) just message me. You will also get the most credit later.<br /> <br />For anyone that has read this cry for help from a little noob, thanks for your time and THANKS in Advance!</p>
