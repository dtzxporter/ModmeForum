<p>Thread By: DrewLunsford79<br />&lt;hr&gt;I was just wondering if anyone has found out how to use the Zombies Chronicles 1.0 crew as playable characters for custom maps because that&#39;d be awesome, if anyone knows how that would be so helpful!</p>

<p>Reply By: Oxford_Mann<br />It is entirely possibly to play as the 1.0&#39;s, but it is extremely complicated to do so. It involves exporting the models, constructing a customizationtable, etc. There are methods for making custom characters, but they&#39;re pretty complicated. I foresee tutorials coming out fairly soon for them.</p>
