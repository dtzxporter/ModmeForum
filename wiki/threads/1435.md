<p>Thread By: cheese<br />I don&#39;t know wh<span style="color:#ffffff;">y but when ever I load any template and run the game it dose not work and it goes to the main lobby so its not the scripts in the map. I am really confused because I even the verified the integrity of the game files in the BO3 and mod tools and it still dose not load my maps. If any one has a suggestion or knows how to fix this <strong>I will be grateful because its preventing me from doing any work on my template</strong> I just hope I don&#39;t have to re-stall my game.</span></p>

<p>Reply By: cheese<br />Just to clarify I think this started happening when I accidentally re installed something that was 88 GB like the DLC</p>

<p>When the mod apk game does not work the easiest way is to delete the game and proceed to download it again</p>
