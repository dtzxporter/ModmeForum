<p>Thread By: iwllstealurbos<br />When ever I add custom sounds to my game, nothing seems to happen, I have tried numerous times to try and add a custom announcer and I follow every step the person says on tutorials or posts and nothing seems to happen and it is the same with adding character vox&#39;s from the wiki tutorial, anyone know why this could be happening?</p>

<p>Reply By: iwllstealurbos<br />I managed to fix it by remaking the .szc file and the quotes and customs sounds started to work</p>
