<p>Thread By: MJPW<br /><p style="text-align:left;">So Ive been having a bit of a issue where when I pick up the new tactical grenade in-game it crashes. Ive even went down to the basics without its scripting and it still crashes. What Im needing help with is the setting up prosses of creating a new tactical grenade (I&#39;ll add in the actual scripting and effects later) and being able to pick it up in-game and throw it (also replacing Monkeys or Lil Arnies).</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">Thanks :) </p></p>
