<p>I am wondering on how this is accomplished exactly.<br />All the available scripts regarding this utilise an actor of sorts (player or a zombie), whilst I want a model/object to be visible through walls.<br /><br /><br /><br />         Material-Related:<br /><ul><li>Do materials always have to be of hud_outline_model(+) to be visible through walls?<br /><li>Do materials (custom included) need to be added to the map&#39;s zone file? <br /><li>Do materials (custom included) start with mc in the zone and script?<br /></li></li></li></ul><br />        Script-Related:<br /><ul><li>Should the .gsc clientfield be called on the player, or the object? Is this correct: <em>(self clientfield::set( &quot;alpha_on&quot;, 1 )</em><br /><li>The clientfield::set name parameter should be the same as the name parameter in clientfield::register, correct?<br /><li>When registering the clientfield, is the correct pool &quot;world&quot;?<br /><li>When setting the .csc duplicate_render::set_dr_flag, should it be called upon the model? Is this correct: <em>(level.object duplicate_render::set_dr_flag( &quot;alpha_on&quot;, n_new ))</em><br /></li></li></li></li></ul><br />If anyone can provide an explanation, a tutorial, or an example of an object (say a powerup) that is visible through walls, it would be greatly appreciated.<br />I have been trying to do this with no avail.</p>
