<p>Thread By: Wild<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Hey. I have been working on completing my BO2 Shader pack so I can move onto my next project. The next update to the pack will finish it, all that&#39;s left to add is tombstone and who&#39;s who. I found the shader for tombstone in the zm.ipak. I figured the who&#39;s who shader would be in dlc1zm.ipak just like how electric cherry is in dlc2zm.ipak and vulture aid is in dlc3zm.pak, however when I export the images from dlc1zm.ipak the only perk shader that comes up is for mule kick. I&#39;ve looked in a few different files and I can&#39;t find the Who&#39;s Who shader anywhere. </p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">Anyone happen to know where it is?</p></p>

It&#39;s really strange how they did that :/</p></p>
