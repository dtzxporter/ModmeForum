<p>Thread By: Zynx<br />This .rar pack includes images for new cookies for lighting in Radiant. I felt the selection was pretty limited so I thought some of these would help expand the combinations to prevent reusing around your map.<br /> <br />&lt;h1&gt;<span style="color:#00ffff;">INSTALLATION:</span>&lt;/h1&gt;<br />Move the &quot;texture_assets&quot; folder in the .rar file to your Black Ops III root folder.<br /> <br />Open APE and search &quot;cookie&quot; under name to check if the assets are there.<br /> <br /><strong>If any issues surface, please inform me about it in this thread.</strong><br /> <br /><strong>NOTE: </strong>The assets included are prefixed with &quot;brick&quot;, &quot;textile&quot;, &quot;radial&quot;, &quot;fractal&quot;, &quot;perlin&quot;, and &quot;turbulence.&quot; (The names of the prefixes simply describe the texture of the cookie, not where it should be used.)<br /> <br />&lt;h3&gt;<span style="color:#00ffff;">CREDITS: </span>&lt;/h3&gt;<br />Christian Petry&#39;s Texture Generator Online<br /> <br />You do not need to credit me if you use these cookies in your map, though it&#39;d be nice if you did!<br /> <br />&lt;h1&gt;<span style="color:#00ffff;">DOWNLOAD:</span>&lt;/h1&gt;<br /><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/12fcjjnm37y8z9f/zynx%2527s_cookie_jar.rar">Download</a></p>
