<p>I am currently trying to add custom player models to a zombies map I am working on and I am having trouble with finding these specific files:<br /><br />mods_character_customization (charactercustomizationtable)<br /><br />pbt_mp_mercenary (playerbodytype)<br />pbt_mp_mercenary_body1_skin1 (playerbodystyle)<br /><br />My apologies if this is something simple that could easily be done. I am new to map making so I don&#39;t exactly know the ins and outs of BO3s files</p>
