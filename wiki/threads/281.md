<p>Reply By: authorjames<br />Open the folder in which Black Ops 3 is located, find the folder named &quot;gdtdb&quot;, this folder is missing a database file which you can download <a href="https://mega.nz/#!vA91XBDA!cOhniglcuIAa1w0t_JvoKHyW1z3V4_MEQY8O4aON9ok">here</a>. Once you got the file, drag it into the folder specified earlier and you should be able to run Radiant with no problems! Hope this helps &lt;i class=&quot;e1a-slight_smile&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</p>
