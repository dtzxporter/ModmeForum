<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />You can only launch your map if you manually open the launcher (not through steam), and they&#39;ll probably never fix it since they have a reputation for not fixing game breaking bugs since launch</p>

They do realize what a big an active community this is and aren&#39;t just going to throw us under the bus.<br /> <br />This is just a pretty bad time as they just revealed Black Ops 4 and have been busy with promotional stuff lately. So I believe they will find a fix, I just hope it doesn&#39;t take too long.</p>
