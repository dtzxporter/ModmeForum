<p>Hi!<br />First, this is awesoooome! I love custom perks and this post is amazing!<br /><br />Second, I have a problem with <strong>Wind Runner Whiskey</strong><br />The model doesn&#39;t appear neither in Radiant and the map, and when I buy it it doesn&#39;t give me the perk and the character is getting stuck, like still drinking the perk, so it doesn&#39;t let me knife or run<br /><br />I don&#39;t know if I do something wrong or someone have this problem too :(</p>

Check the GSH for the define.<br />As for the textures, I think I may have fucked up. Abnormal keeps his texture assets in &quot;texture_assets&quot; and I may have forgotten to move them into the folder I created. I&#39;ll double check later and upload a fix if that&#39;s the problem.</p>

<p>OP updated to include new link. To reinstall, you don&#39;t have to copy everything if you already installed the perks prior. Copy over model_export and source_data which will update the GDT files and include the missing texture.<br /><br /><blockquote>I&#39;m using them wit Madgaz&#39;s and Harrybo&#39;s perks and neither perk icons appear.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Are you sure you haven&#39;t overwritten the hud lua files?<br /><br />Check this location: usermaps\your_map_name\ui\uieditor\menus\hud\t7hud_zm_custom.lua and confirm all the perk icons are there. Also make sure you&#39;re including the zpkg files for each set of perks and also loading the lua inside your mapname.csc &gt;:^ )<br />You shouldn&#39;t have to be told, especially if you&#39;re using Harry&#39;s perks, but just in case, you need the lua mod to actually load the HUD</p>

<p>Just some ideas lol.<br /><br />Would it be possible to create some black ops 4 perks as bo3 perk machines? Like:<br /><br />TimeSlip (e.g. TimeSlip Soda, reduces mystery box weapon-appearing times and pack-a-punch time. Possibly could fully refill grenades at the start of the round?),<br />Bandolier Bandit (could be used instead of Salvage Soda, e.g. Bandolier Beer, increases stock ammo capacity by 10%),<br />Dying Wish. (e.g. Dying Wish Delight, works exact same as bo4), etc. etc.<br /><br />Great work so far man! Keep it up ! :D</p>

I have some work around ideas that I&#39;ll toy with eventually.<br /><br />I&#39;m about to add a new perk to the pack, similar to Dying Wish from Bo4, however, I&#39;ve made some slight changes that I personally feel fit bo3 more. I just need to get a perk model/retexture done.<br /><br />I know someone on the mod tools discord has already got most of the bo4 perks working, so perhaps they will release them :) If not, I can work on some of them for sure.</p>

<p>Instructions forgot to say add:<br />rawfile,ui/uieditor/menus/hud/t7hud_zm_custom.lua<br />rawfile,ui/uieditor/widgets/hud/customperksfactory.luac<br />to zone file.<br />Also there is a problem with Wind Runner Whiskey and Stamin-Up where if you buy Stamin-Up first you will also get Wind Runner Whiskey but the shader wont show up. To fix this I simply changed the specialty in the GSH and in the prefab to specialty_armorpiercing</p>

<p><blockquote>~SNIPPEH<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Thanks man, I totally missed that, my bad. I&#39;ll update the package to fix the bugs reported. There are a few other things that are wrong with the pack. You might&#39;ve noticed some of the materials are missing for example, probably invalid references or something, I&#39;ve just not had the time to sit down and go over it.<br /><br />I&#39;ll fix em up in the next week or two and update the pack. Thanks again.</p>

<p><blockquote>###WELCOME POST###<br /><br />Yo yo, welcome to the Community Perk Pack mega thread. This thread is the beginning of a hopefully awesome and successful project. Read on if this has tweaked your interest, or nipples.... Please make sure you read the important notes section, or you may end up breaking your existing assets. Keep in mind this is a work in progress and there will be more to come. If I missed anyone on the credits list, I&#39;m sorry, there are a lot of people and I may have forgotten you. Respond here, or contact me via DM/Discord and I&#39;ll write my wrong.<br /><br /><strong>What is the &quot;Community Perk Pack&quot; you ask?</strong><br />Well good question! The community perk pack is a compilation of publicly released perks, made by various members of the community and packaged as a single download by me. With the potential of custom perks, I figured it might be nice to have a central location with all the perks in one place. I also wanted to allow anyone access to the perks, regardless of if you have Harry&#39;s perks or not. This does mean I had to remove some features... Read Important notes for more info.<br /><br /><strong>Do you have a perk you want to include in this pack?</strong><br />Sure that&#39;d be awesome, however, I will only accept &quot;Quality&quot; work in this  pack. What does Quality mean? Well, the perks must fit in with the original theme of Zombies. You do not need a jingle to be included, but you must include the perk and at least a retextured model of an existing perk. While I realise that this is quite ambiguous, it is to stop &quot;crap&quot; from being packaged into this pack. There is a difference between a perk you dislike and one that does not fit the bill of a perk. If you still need direction, please take a look at the existing perks in this pack.<br /><br /><strong>I have some suggestions!</strong><br />Great, post them in this thread :)<br /><br /><strong>I have some perk ideas, but I can&#39;t script :(</strong><br />Nice one, post them in this thread and if they fit the theme I might give it a crack. Keep in mind not everything is possible. I may or may not even acknowledge your perk idea but I mean no disrespekt.<br /><br /><strong>Why don&#39;t you have custom models for your perks Kaizokuroof?</strong><br />Because I&#39;m a fucking scrub mate, and I can&#39;t model. If you think you could make a model that would fit the perk, please contact me I&#39;d love to work with you :)<br /><br /><strong>What did you even do Kaizokuroof?</strong><br />I packaged the perks together, changed some of the directory paths that I felt better/easier to modify. I updated all of Abnormal202&#39;s perks to use an FX for their lights, use the Bo3 bottle/animations and consolidated the aliases. I did a few renames and basically just changed it all so I could maintain the perks easier. I also removed some of the unsupported features that required you to have HarryBo21 perks. This unfortunately does mean certain things no longer work, such as the support of stock wunderfizz, or Vultures Aid FX<br /><br /><strong>Does this work with HarryBo21 perks?</strong><br />Yes, they should, however I will not cover how to install them side by side, however, none of the perks in this pack will support Harry&#39;s features, such as Vultures Aid or Wunderfizz.<br /><br /><strong>Do these perks work with Madgaz Wunderfizz 2.0?</strong><br />Yes, they will, however you will need to update some things in Madgaz scripts. At some stage I am hoping he will allow me to incorporate his perks/wunderfizz into this pack, so we can truely have a central location for custom perks.<br /><br /><strong>Big thanks</strong> to the below people. They directly, or indirectly worked on these perks in some way and without them this pack would not be possible. For individual perk credit list, please see each perks description.<br />Abnormal202, HarryBo21, Booris, Wyburn, Raptroes, Xspicious, Madgaz, Logical Edits, Jerri, NSZ, DTZxPorter, Leathal Peels, Robit, Symbo, ApexModder, NoobForLunch, Z1620, Planet, Verk0 and many others -&gt; List to be updated further later.<br /><br /><strong>Special thanks to:</strong><br />- DTZxPorter<br />- Abnormal202<br />- HarryBo21<br />- Robit<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Important Notes:</span></strong><br />To make these perks work without Harry&#39;s utilities or perks, I had to remove some core features of the perks, specifically, the perks do not support Bo3 Wunderfizz (Does support Madgaz wunderfizz 2.0), Vultures Aid or the ability to pause the perks. I will work on this at some stage, but it was already a lot of work to get it into this state and I need a break for now. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">If you already have Abnormal&#39;s perks and want to use features like Wunderfizz/Vultures Aid, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">do not install his perks from this pack</span></strong></span></strong>, but instead see his own custom perk threads for original unedited files. <a href="https://forum.modme.co/threads/snails-pace-slurpee-custom-perk.2294/">Snails Pace Slurpee</a>, <a href="https://forum.modme.co/threads/cryo-slide-soda-custom-perk.2381/">Cryo Slide Soda</a>.

When the zombie reaches another smaller, inner radius, or if it gets too far away from the player, it is sped back up.<br /><br />Sounds complicated? Basically it just slows zombies when they get too close, but won&#39;t slow them down when they start hitting you. This gives players extra time before zombies can hit them, and can really save the player in some sticky situations, but not all.<br /><br />You can change many of the settings of Snail&#39;s Pace within the _zm_perk_snails_pace_slurpee.gsh including a new feature that slows down zombies exceptionally when a player with Snail&#39;s Pace goes down.<br /><br />Snails Pace Slurpee Credits:<br />-Abnormal202<br />-NSZ<br />-Harrybo21<br />-Frost Iceforge<br />-Kaizokuroof (bo3 perk bottle textures/port)<br /><br /><strong>Cryo Slide Soda:</strong><br /><a href="https://forum.modme.co/threads/cryo-slide-soda-custom-perk.2381/"><strong>Original Thread</strong></a><br />36<br /><strong>Perk Jingle:</strong><br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eUb0zQm3_ZU" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br /><strong>Description:</strong><br />Whenever you slide or knife, all nearby zombies will become frozen for 5 seconds.
