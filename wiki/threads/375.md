<p>Thread By: rossdaboss<br />sometimes when i walk into certain areas of my map, all the zombies will just stop moving as if the game thinks i&#39;m out of bounds. my zones and zombie spawns are set up correctly so i don&#39;t know what is causing this.</p>

Thanks anyways:)</p>

<p>Reply By: rossdaboss<br />I messed around with my zombie spawners and zones a little more and now they don&#39;t  even get to the barrier. They just walk in place where they spawned. Does anyone know a fix for this?</p>

<p>Reply By: rossdaboss<br />I went into my other map i have that has Brutus and dog rounds on it. The same issue is still happening with the zombies and it&#39;s also happening with Brutus and the dogs. They both spawn in on their rounds and just stand there. Whenever I walk close to the zombies, Brutus, or a dog they attack me but when I back away they go back to standing still</p>

I&#39;ll check for area where the zombies can walk when I get home</p>

The issue was that my launcher and radiant had been acting weird for about a week and it messed up a lot of stuff up. Then today an update came out for mod tools, and when it was done downloading I recompiled my map and all the spawns were working fine.</p>
