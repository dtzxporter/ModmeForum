<p>Thread By: ItsJasonn<br />Hello there,<br /> <br />Let&#39;s get straight to what I am struggling with. I am trying to make a flying blue orb that goes smoothly up and down very slowly. What I already have is a FX that goes up and down. But there are 2 problems that I need help with:<br />&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The FX goes up and down around 10 times a second (<a href="https://gyazo.com/479ddf8477b4fe62faeb331acfe59ac3">https://gyazo.com/479ddf8477b4fe62faeb331acfe59ac3</a>)&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;The FX does NOT go up and down smoothly. I want it to accelerate at the start and decelerate at the end of going up. The same for going down.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ul&gt; <br />Thank you!</p>
