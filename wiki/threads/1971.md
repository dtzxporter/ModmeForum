<p>Thread By: Noah Gamerscore<br />So I don&#39;t really need help with something, I&#39;m just curious. Is there like a maximum file size your map can be? And Size I mean like .map file you open in radiant, is there a maximum file size or is it like unlimited or something. Thank you for answering my quick question and thanks for taking you time to answer it!! :)</p>

<p>Reply By: DTZxPorter<br />I&#39;ve seen and worked with map files that hit over 30mb in size (Map basically hits every in-game limit, brushes, collision, etc) You&#39;ll hit the brush / collision limit before you reach a size limit.</p>
