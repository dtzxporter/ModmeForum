<p>Thread By: Gasgas120<br />Is it possible to have a rocket launch to a specific place without using animations? I feel like it might be, but how would I have the rocket move along a path and be facing towards the right direction. What I&#39;m thinking is maybe a struct could be going along the same path, but in front of the rocket and at the same speed. <br /> <br />edit- I wouldn&#39;t know how to script it, lol</p>
