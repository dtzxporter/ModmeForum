Also off-topic to issue but you can reduce those platform functions (14 of them I think?) to 1 with arrays and loops and threading.

<p>Reply By: KillJoyYT<br />how would i get that function down to only one? and do models count as an entity?<br /> <br />so basically everything on the map is an entity?<br /> <br /> <br />i have all the platforms for different doors and they all act differently with different trigs and such</p>
