<p>Lets say regular ammo costs 750. If I buy PaP ammo in game, it says the upgraded ammo costs 750, when it really charges 4500. How can I change the players display to say the correct value??</p>

<p>updating triggers a lot can cause max trigger hint crashes, I would just stick with the bug, but if you want to, you just need to write a small override script per player and weapon check. I would make it static and just drop a line and say both the non pap and pap cost so you dont have to keep updating triggers</p>

<p>How do I display both prices at the same time? What exactly should I be editing?</p>
