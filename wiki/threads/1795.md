<p>Thread By: XxRaPiDK3LLERxX<br /><p style="text-align:left;">This recently happened, whenever I try to build lighting, radiant starts to take 12GB RAM and stops responding then two cmd windows appears and force close radiant. There&#39;s no error message...</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p></p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br /><p style="text-align:left;">what setting are you building on? cause you should probably be building on Low for testing, and maybe medium if you want to test how it looks. Building it on high takes forever and consumes all the RAM the computer has to offer for the duration its buliding, often causing it to crash if try to open anything else up before its done. I would recommend only building on High right before you publish a map.</p></p>

<p>Reply By: XxRaPiDK3LLERxX<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Thank you guys, it seems like OC for my GPU doesn&#39;t like radiant when building high lighting. So I put the GPU on default settings and it works! Although, the game appears with a blank screen after compiling, linking and lighting, even though there are no script errors.</p></p>
