<p>Thread By: WhippyTrout<br />So basically when a player dies then re-spawns next round he has no weapons. He is holding nothing. He has to buy a wall weapon in order to get a gun. I tried using the stock loadout.gsc and stock laststand.gsc but it still happens. I&#39;m using the default &quot;zombie_colt&quot; as my starting pistol, nothing special. <br /><br /><br /><br />Please Help me out this has to be a simple fix. <br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br /><br /><br />Whippy</p>
