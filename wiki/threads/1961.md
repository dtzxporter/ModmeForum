<p>Thread By: TheMikeyMan<br />I&#39;ve recently just finished porting over the blundergat (might upload it later but after I get this figured out), I wanted to make a pack a punched version but I can&#39;t find the model for it and I know there is a separate model for it because it looks different in game. I&#39;m using wraith to pull my models, and if anyone can tell me how to find the pack a punched sound files that would be great too because I can only find the original models, anims and sounds for the base weapons but never for the upgraded.</p>

<p>Reply By: TheMikeyMan<br />How would I enable the part of the model and would my anims still work with it or do I need to redo them with the new model?</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />It&#39;s the same model and the same anims<br /> <br />you just set different hide tags on the weapon files for the blunder gat and the acid gat<br /> <br />its the same for the sweeper / vitriolic withering - except they also have a second model attached called &quot;armor&quot;<br /> <br />pm me or find me on discord if you need help, I just finished the blunder gat and acid gat</p>

<p>Reply By: TheMikeyMan<br />Would I do this in APE or Maya, or do modify the xmodel files or something? And how do I get the sound for the upgraded blundergat? Or do modify the existing firing sound for the bludnergat</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br /><blockquote><em>Harry Bo21</em><br /> hide tags on the <strong>weapon files</strong></blockquote><br /> <br />these are in APE<br /> <br />the fire sound for the acid gat is a totally different sound altogether, youd need to go rip it from bo2</p>

<p>Reply By: Undefeatable<br />Blundergat was made by Jdcobra1 &amp; Jerrigaming. Jerri created Acid Gat weapon. How did Jerrigaming do that?</p>
