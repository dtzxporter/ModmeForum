<p>How would I go about importing the Apothicon Sword as a Specialist with the upgrade steps and how you would normally aqcuire it in Shadows of Evil. I was messing around the APE and saw it in there and was wondering how to import it for the next map I want to create.</p>

Not a powerup. I want the sword just how you could obtain it in Shadows of Evil. Getting the Apothicon Eggs, getting kills at each statue, going back to where you got the egg and placing it there to get the sword as a specialist weapon. Thanks for this though, I might be able to use it with a different project!</p>
