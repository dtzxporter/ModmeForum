This is mainly intended for the bois out there that are starting to use mod tools and want to make some lit maps.</em><br /> <br /> <br /><em>YOU HAVE BEEN  W A R N E D ! ! !</em><br /> <br /> <br />Well there really isn&#39;t much else to say other than these add the sound files and stuff for the perks and such.<br /> <br />So I&#39;ll just leave this here and I&#39;ll just slowly... walk out of here... uh... yeah... I&#39;m just gonna go... mmm... yeah I&#39;ll go the other way... oh wait that way is blocked. Okay I&#39;ll go the way I was just going. Alright bye!<br /> <br />(1/18/18) Forgot credits but here<br />DTZxPorter - Wraith, software used to extract the sound files<br /> <br />and can&#39;t remember who supplied the aliases for me but it was a friend from discord, I&#39;ll try to find who it is<br /><a href="https://mega.nz/#!F2ITXDzC!rWLpsDM52URJ7BOBYbYDEwFfPX69LTpNqroG9ePpMYg">Download</a> <br />(1/16/18) So the download link should work now, if it doesn&#39;t then IDK.<br /> <br /><em>And yes I know there&#39;s a perk and sound alias thing on the wiki that I didn&#39;t know about until very recently. Because some places are harder to navigate (for me at least anyways) I&#39;m still going to keep this up just incase people deal with the same problem. Don&#39;t get triggered at me for keeping this up, I just want to help out the community one way or another. Don&#39;t be salty and act like you own the modding community, because I thought this modding community was supposed to be a happy place where people can share their own creative things and go beyond the charts with it, but now that I see it there&#39;s a lot of drama here, and it&#39;s a hard thing to understand. Please just be nice and let other people do their thing as long as it doesn&#39;t break any terms of service codes or anything.</em></p>

Perhaps add some steps on how to include it all for those who are new or are they included in a readme? Idk as I can&#39;t access the download.<br /> <br />Good stuff :)</p>

So what if I don&#39;t know what the modme wiki is. why do you have to make a big deal over something this small. I said nobody barely visits it because nobody&#39;s ever mentioned it like it has never existed. I honestly don&#39;t give the biggest shit about it, and you and other people shouldn&#39;t either. Honestly, why are we all arguing over something this simple, probably because &quot;I&#39;m wrong&quot; or something. Again, not a single fuck given. This is literally just a forum. If this post is triggering everyone because it helps people forget about the wiki, then so be it. The wiki is dead. This arguement is pointless, just admit it. Did I really shit in your cornflakes that hard? And yes I know I said I wasn&#39;t going to put up with this anymore, but I still have to fix what was started: this bs arguement. I don&#39;t care if my points are even the slightest of invalid, because yet again, this doesn&#39;t matter. Anymore negative things keeping this bs going, I&#39;m not replying to. Something positive can make the world just at least a little bit better. So can you please kindly wander off and not waste anymore time on this. All that was intended for this post was to just help people out. I never expected this much controversy.</p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />this post is actually hilarious. The amount of drama over this little thing is amazing. Keep it up people. saying &quot;This arguement is pointless&quot; does not excuse you from being equally stupid for perpetuating it. Not to mention the hypocrisy of asking everyone else to &quot;please kindly wander off and not waste anymore time on this&quot; when you could&#39;ve (and probably should&#39;ve) done it yourself a long time ago.<br /> <br /> <br />P.S: before anyone snarkily responds &quot;I know right &quot; do keep in mind if you posted anything to this you&#39;ve added to the drama, myself included.<br /> <br />kinda surprised admins haven&#39;t just locked this topic yet, or even deleted it since its so redundant.</p>

You are by far the most disgusting individual I&#39;ve seen in the modding community. Respecting others is a rule on this server, if he is going down, chances are you are going down with him. Go fuck yourself.</p>

<p>Reply By: Barple Bapkins<br />Jesus H. Christ, someone has sparked one hell of a wildfire here.<br />From what I&#39;m seeing here, OP decided to repost some assets and Harry ain&#39;t havin&#39; it.<br /> <br />Now lemme try to be civil for a minute here.<br /> <br />I&#39;m not trying to defend anyone here, but Harry you&#39;re kinda overreacting the situation a little bit dude. All you had to say is &quot;Hey man, I can take care of this, thanks for trying at least.&quot; But you&#39;re kinda just bashing him for being new to this sorta thing, give him a chance and try to steer him in the right direction for a quick minute instead of being bitter, you&#39;re only stressing him out for not knowing. I kinda thought better out of one of the pillars of the modding community.<br /> <br />As for the OP, just don&#39;t drag on useless conversations that turn into drama like this one, only makes you a laughing stock of the event. If you can&#39;t handle the rough situation, just walk away from it, I know you got some anxiety issues, but stop to think for minute on what you&#39;re about to do.<br /> <br /> <br />Anywho, that&#39;s my two cents on this topic.</p>
