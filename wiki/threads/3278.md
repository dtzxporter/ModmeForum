<p>The title says it all. I&#39;m looking for someone with good knowledge on scripting to script the main Easter Egg in my map. I&#39;m dont want anything extremely difficult or too thought out about.<br /><br />If you are interested, please PM me and we will talk about EVERYTHING involving what I want, how we will go about it, etc. When my map is released on the Steam Workshop, you will take FULL credit alongside me in the creation of the map as the &quot;scripter&quot;, and it will be published with you, on your workshop page as a &quot;creator&quot;.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Please PM me if interested, even if others have already mentioned that they have messaged me down below.<br /><br /><br /><br />Regards,<br />the_bibba_boy</p>
