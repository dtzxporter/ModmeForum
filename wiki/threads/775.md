<p>Thread By: snprym<br /><p style="text-align:left;">I was thinking about making a custom zombie blood powerup because i figured it would be super easy because the Gobble gum &quot;In Plain Sight&quot; has the exact same effect. So my question is , can u use the existing gobble gum script for a powerup?</p></p>

I avoided zombie blood because I didnt feel like dealing with the vision at the time of making my other powerups. If you hang tight for some time I can code and release it</p></p>
