<p>So i have just followed Ice Grenade&#39;s tutorial on how to add auto triggering sounds and i have a trigger that plays background music when you walk into certain areas. However it plays over the round music, is there a way i can have the music fade out while that plays, or can it do it the other way around, preventing the round music from playing while that music is playing?</p>

<p>I think it was MusicStates that were done for these kind of things, but I&#39;m not sure if anyone really digged into this.</p>
