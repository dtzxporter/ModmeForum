<p>Thread By: Scorpiolo<br />Hi, I&#39;m creating the easter egg for my map and I&#39;m using Make cents soul boxes script.<br /> <br />What I want to do is have multiple sets of soul boxes each then threading a different function in my gsc for the next easter egg step. I&#39;d like to have one set of soul boxes as an ee step, then the second set only able to be completed when teleported into the boss fight. Anyone know how to do this?<br /> <br />Thanks<br />Sam</p>
