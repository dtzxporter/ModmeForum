<p><blockquote>alright ill try this stuff an<br /><br /><br />so I downloaded the addons except the last on because it didnt work still getting similar errors.<br /></blockquote><br />firstly sounds like youve not copied the xanim_export over from the download<br /><br />secondly you dont need my ai stuff anyway, just delete the 3 folders from your map folder</p>

<p><blockquote>firstly sounds like youve not copied the xanim_export over from the download<br /><br />secondly you dont need my ai stuff anyway, just delete the 3 folders from your map folder<br /></blockquote><br /><br />I am using some of your zombies. I believe the napalm zombies and the nova crawlers are yours. I think that when I originally had the sonic zombies and removed them the extra ai stuff is from them. I deleted the animstatemachines, animtables, and behavior from my zm folder but that didnt seem to change much. I am just confused because isn&#39;t genesis the usermap ai scripts. would validating my game files help maybe or is that just a waste of time?</p>
