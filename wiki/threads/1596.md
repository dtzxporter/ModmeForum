<p>Thread By: ProRevenge<br />So I&#39;m using the AW M1911 model, and it has some dodgy lines that show on it when lit in certain ways, ive tried for hours to fix this but am getting nowhere, been told it was to do with vertex normals but have no idea how to use them to sort this, I cant even figure out how to select verts in Maya (and google is no help)<br /><br /><br /><br />Here is a rough idea of whats happening, its not just this line too, there are other places on the model where lighting just looks dodgy in game<br /><br /><a href="https://gyazo.com/5c08a52c3d26992022988610927f289f">https://gyazo.com/5c08a52c3d26992022988610927f289f</a></p>
