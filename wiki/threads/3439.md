<p>thanks for changing the script and adding x2 new pre fabs ....however it still don&#39;t work you still need 2 tp pre_fabs for it to work but then it will tp the player to either end point at random <br /><br />even with the x2 new pre_fabs its the same also with the 2 new tps (&quot;portal_bottom&quot; and portal_top) the fx don&#39;t play when u get to the end point ....thanks again I&#39;m halfway in to a map with 4 destinations but would need to tp to each one not random i am using a tp script wit 0 fx and the zombs don&#39;t follow with the one I&#39;m using so would really want to use this one <br /><br />thanks again</p>

<p><blockquote>ahh man still not working atall now is there a way i can send u a short vid of it set up and what is happing ?<br />thanks for your help so far<br /></blockquote><br />what isn&#39;t working? using one teleporter? just use the tele_top prefab and use the tele tele_bottom&#39;s script_struct bit only if you only want it one way, or just the top and bottom if you want the player to be able to tele back.</p>

<p>If I understand you correctly, you want six teleporters with one in each room. You also want all of the teleporters to be linked to the first room?</p>

<p>yes but i had to take out * rand and the line<br />```<br />//rand = RandomFloatRange(0.9,1.1); is commented its the only way i can get it to work with out putting me eather out the map or under it is there a diff way to allow the players to not hit each other on destination  as yes i can use *rand but i get put in some strange places an the struct  is as high in the air as the default model head here is the script as i have it<br /><br />function teleport_player(user)<br />{<br />    if(IsDefined(user.teleporting) &amp;&amp; user.teleporting == true)<br />    {<br />        return;<br />    }<br />    user.teleporting = true;<br />    self thread teleporting_zombies(user);<br />    PlayFX( TELE_BEAM, self.origin);<br />    self playsound( &quot;kino_beam_fx&quot; );<br />    //rand = RandomFloatRange(0.9,1.1);<br />    if(isdefined(self.target))<br />    {<br />        destination = struct::get(self.target, &quot;targetname&quot;);<br />        user setstance( &quot;stand&quot; );<br />        wait(0.1);<br />        //user playlocalsound( &quot;zmb_black_hole_bomb_teleporter_go&quot; );<br />        user DisableWeapons();<br />        user DisableOffhandWeapons();<br />        user freezecontrols( true );<br />        // trying to force angles on player.<br />        user SetOrigin( destination.origin );<br />        user SetPlayerAngles( destination.angles );<br />        PlayFX( TELE_BEAM, user.origin);<br />        user playlocalsound( &quot;kino_teleport_2d&quot; );<br />    }<br />    else<br />    {       <br />        // script origin trigger destination targets for player placement.<br />        player_destination = struct::get(&quot;final_dest&quot;, &quot;targetname&quot;);<br />        user setstance( &quot;stand&quot; );<br />        wait(0.1);<br />        user playlocalsound( &quot;kino_teleport_2d&quot; );<br />        user DisableWeapons();<br />        user DisableOffhandWeapons();<br />        user freezecontrols( true );<br />        // trying to force angles on player.<br />        user SetOrigin( player_destination.origin );<br />        user SetPlayerAngles( player_destination.angles );<br />        PlayFX( TELE_BEAM, user.origin);<br />    }<br />    wait(0.5);<br />    user enableweapons();<br />    user enableoffhandweapons();<br />    user FreezeControls( false );<br />    user.teleporting = false;<br />}<br /><br />```</p>
