<p><a href="https://forum.modme.co/threads/the-giant-voice-pack.2394/">https://forum.modme.co/threads/the-giant-voice-pack.2394/</a><br />So this forum is amazing and it has all the quotes I need in the map, theres just one issue which is the spawn quotes that each character say, they just don&#39;t activate. Does anyone know the problem with this? I will be greatly appreciative</p>
