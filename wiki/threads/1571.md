<p>Thread By: apechound<br />So I imported a model into my map and when I view it in Radiant, it looks fine and I can see the textures perfectly, but when I run the map one of the main textures doesn&#39;t load and instead uses the default blue and orange checker board texture. I also get an error in the feedback interface of the mod launcher when compiling saying &#39;The model (tardis) uses material (tardis1) but there is no techset for surface 3&#39;</p>

<p>Reply By: uptownpapi25<br />go to ape and check the images for the model, the one that has a &quot;c&quot; in the end , change to best color compression. maybe that will help.</p>
