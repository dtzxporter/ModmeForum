<p><blockquote>It depends on what you want to do after<br />, I could do it<br /></blockquote><br />Right now I just want the players to be able to pick up brushes models to move them around the map then just drop them. But in the future want to have the players grab brushes and place them down in SPECIFIC locations then text pop ups then a gun or something appears.</p>

<p>I can walk you through it but im not gonna make it.<br />Basically you first spawn triggers around the script brushmodels.<br />When a player triggers it, link the brushmodel to the player (or hide it)<br />When the player presses F or melee or whatever, unlink or move and show the block. Its probably a good idea to make an imaginary grid and align the block to it.<br />To check if the block is at a specific spot just do a if(distance(block.origin, spot.origin)&lt; 50)<br />and ofc respawn the trigger to pick up the block again</p>
