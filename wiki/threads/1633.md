<p>Thread By: apechound<br />Recently, I&#39;ve been trying to export a model I downloaded that was made in Blender to use in a map, and when I&#39;ve exported it as an xmodel then gone to convert it through Kronos, it says that it failed conversion.<br />When I try using the original export2bin.exe method, it gives me an error message saying:<br />&quot;ERROR: UINT16: Out of range value for NUMVERTS in file&quot;<br /> <br />Any ideas how I could get round this?</p>

Select VERSION 7 on the bottom left when you go to export the file.<br /> <br />You can try this version of Blender-CoD by replacing the files in<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\scripts\addons\io_scene_cod
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
with the files from <em><strong>{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
blender_27
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
</strong></em> folder in the development branch here: <a href="https://github.com/CoDEmanX/blender-cod/tree/development">https://github.com/CoDEmanX/blender-cod/tree/development</a></p>

Do you have an armature in the scene?</p>
