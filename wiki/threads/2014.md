<p>Thread By: Fil he Modder<br />so i have an ammo crate model that has a lid that can be moved using the pose manipulator, but i was wondering if it&#39;s possible for the lid to automatically open or close depending on how close i am to it, can someone show me how to do that?</p>

dist = Distance2D( player.origin, ammo_box.origin );

if(dist &lt;= 200)
{
     open_the_box();
}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />like this for example.<br /> <br />Could this be done using script movement (rotate, MoveTo)? or would it be an animation?</p>
