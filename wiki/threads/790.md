<p>Thread By: DorDur215<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Ok so me and a few friends are working on a big weapon mod for black ops 3. Since I have ported the Mauser C96 and the M1911 I dont want to pick only 1 for the mod. So I need a script to be able to chose your starting weapon per player. How I imagined it is that you spawn in the map with nothing in your hands then a 2 texts come up which read Press &quot;button1&quot; for Mauser C96 and Press &quot;button2&quot; for M1911. I would like to be able to customize the positioning and the thickness of the text. Support for images ( like a weapon image above the text ) isnt necessary but would be greatly appreciated. And the last thing this script needs is that whatever starting weapon a player chose will be the weapon that he gets when you go down ( the upgraded version ofc ). <iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nBTYCLZ" frameborder="0"></iframe> This is how I would like it to look ingame. Now I know this is alot and maybe its even impossible but there are so many talented scripters out there Im sure someone could make my dream come true! Proper credit will be given when the mod releases.</p></p>
