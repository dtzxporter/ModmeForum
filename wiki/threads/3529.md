<p>Hey, all of a sudden, my map duplicated itself. What I mean is that when I run the game, it looks like the entire map got duplicated, then rotated so the duplicates mix with each other. I hope that makes some kind of sense, but basically in the spawn room, there will be a duplicate of another room intersecting with it. It&#39;s really weird, especially because it came out of nowhere. I was able to open the map in radiant once and built the lighting to see if that would matter, but it wouldn&#39;t let me light the map. Now I can&#39;t open the map in radiant. Sorry if that makes no sense, like the title suggests, its really weird.</p>
