<p>Thread By: belly3031<br />If anyone could help that would be great!<br /> <br />I want to know how to have it so when you pick up a certain part for it be connected with fx so it disappears when the item is picked up. (Cause it looks dumb if the fx is still there to indicate its there after its been picked up) Seems simple I think but I&#39;m not sure how to do this. <br /> <br />Basically like the staff parts how they have the glow around them. <br /> <br />Thanks :)</p>

At the beginning of the map or whenever the parts spawn in, spawn in an invisible ent on the origin of the part, and then PlayFxOnTag on that.<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
fxOrg = util::spawn_model( "tag_origin", part.origin);
PlayFxOnTag( MY_FX, fxOrg, "tag_origin" );
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
then when the player picks up the part and the part is deleted in script, also delete the invisible ent the FX is being played on.<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
fxOrg Delete();
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}

I&#39;m trying to do it for harrybo1&#39;s weapons staff parts.</p>
