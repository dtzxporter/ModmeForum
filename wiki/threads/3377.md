<p>I want to sort of copy zetsobou with having multiple switches that open a door, hitting 2 switches in a room will open a door and then beyond that door theres another button or switch to open other parts of the map. the trig stuff wouldnt be an issue, but i want the trigs to be on a switch model that flips when activated.</p>

<p>If your only issue is the flipping switch, can&#39;t you just make the switch a script model and then rotate it when activated?</p>
