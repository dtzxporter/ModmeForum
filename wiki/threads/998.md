<p>Thread By: Abnormal202<br />Hello, I&#39;m trying to make a script where a different model appears depending on what box location the box is in. I&#39;ve been looking through _zm_magicbox.gsc for hours and I just can&#39;t seem to figure out how to find the box that is active in script, and use that to make a certain script_model appear. If anyone else has experience working with the mysterybox system in Black Ops 3, your help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />Found the answer myself. The way you grab the current active mystery box is with level.chests[level.chest_index].</p>
