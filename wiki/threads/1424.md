<p>Thread By: Zixology<br />I have a version of this code already. It&#39;s worked for me in the past but just gives me a Link error now. I haven&#39;t changed anything with it.<br />Wondering if anyone else has a different variation or could help me get it working again. I&#39;d post the code I have here, but I forgot how to format the code in a post on here and don&#39;t want to upset any of the mods so... yeah...</p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />Idk if you got the code in a separate gsc but since it&#39;s giving you a link error then maybe you may have to delete <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
#using ../../_bb;
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />to format code click here<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/Fmj4Xx5.png"><br /> <br /> <br />an alternative is<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
#using scripts\zm\_zm_bgb;

player bgb::give( "zm_bgb_perkaholic" );
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
