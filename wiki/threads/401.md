<p>Thread By: soul-toktzt<br />What can cause this? It&#39;s only happening on one floor of my castle, i tried raising the ceiling a bit higher (i already raised it with 16 distance). But the ceiling on the floor below it, is waay lower than this one and it doesn&#39;t happen there.<br /> <br />Edit:<br /> <br /><a href="https://gyazo.com/198b32126cda4e4aad1ec2d739d6fb90">In this room it happens</a><br /> <br /><a href="https://gyazo.com/3bb4576556356c72e1ad8608ad3fc255">In this room it doesn&#39;t happen</a><br /> <br />(character model is to show the how high the ceiling is.)</p>
