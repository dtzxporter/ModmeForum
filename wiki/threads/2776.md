<p>Hi!<br />Before I go and &quot;re-invent the wheel&quot;, I was wondering if someone has already gone to the trouble of converting the EFX files from the other Call of Duty&#39;s to work in BO3.<br />I do have Ardivee&#39;s EFX converter, but there still is alot of manual editing to get them to work. I wonder if Porter or Scobalula have dabbled with them ?... :p</p>
