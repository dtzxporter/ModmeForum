<p>Thread By: HanGoveR_115<br />Hi, I just start scripting in BO3 but only the smalls things, so I&#39;m still a begginer.<br /> <br />I wanted to know if it is possible to attach a light to the players or them weapons. <br /> <br />For exemple, I would like to replace the sheild with a light.<br /> <br />thanks you</p>
