<p>Thread By: PyroPlaysPC<br />Hello, i&#39;m having a bit of a problem here. I&#39;ve been busy porting weapons in my map and i did everything exactly like in a tutorial, but i get a blue box instead of the gun when i drag in the entity. After i compile, light and link and then run the map i get following error: &quot;no xmodel for weap index ... (...). Someone know a fix?</p>
