<p>Thread By: changcow<br />In my map zones work perfectly and zombies don&#39;t spawn til they&#39;re opened and it&#39;s all fine and dandy. The problem is that I thought zombies would only spawn one or two adjacent zones away but they&#39;re still spawning on the other side of the map with like 3 zones distance and takes forever on lower rounds. Is this part of that game and is there any way to fix this?<br />Thanks,<br />ChangCow</p>

<p>Reply By: Wild<br />They aren&#39;t 100% properly set up then. They should only be spawning in the adjacent zones that connect the zone you&#39;re in.</p>

&lt;span class="no"&gt;level&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;flag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"always_on"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
&lt;span class="no"&gt;level&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;flag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"always_on"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />After that they kept spawning at the start_zone but that&#39;s because I had a zone specifically made so that weird parts of the maps wouldn&#39;t kill you so that made them spawn far away. So I changed that to a init_zone instead and that fixed it. Thanks for the help <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://aviacreations.com/modme/emoticons/smile.png"></p>
