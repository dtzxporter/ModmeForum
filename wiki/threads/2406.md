<p>Reply By: Doobsterr<br />The weapons available right now work mostly perfectly. You were quite helpful on discord. 10/10 got my problem solved easily and quickly. Also, all the weapons do horrible damage. The upgraded ICR-7 took like a third of the mag to kill 1 zombie to the head on round 4. They all just do very little damage.</p>

<p>Reply By: TheJaguarPlays<br /><blockquote><em>ii_R3cKY0urS3LF_x</em><br />New Weapon Added!   Please Read The Updates Section As It Has Some Information Involving The Black Ops 4 Weapons!   New Weapon Added: Ray Gun </blockquote><br /> Hi I had a question about porting guns, first of all is there a tutorial you would recomend to watch? Also I wanted to ask if it&#39;s harder to port guns from bo4 to bo3, I know it could be a bit harder because it&#39;s still pretty close to launch day, but that&#39;s why I&#39;m asking if it&#39;s hard to port the bo4 guns to bo3. Also you probably hate requests and shit, I  get it. But if you&#39;re planning to port more of the bo4 guns, I would really love to see the strife pistol. But like I said, you probably hate requests for weapons. But just if you don&#39;t have any idea what to port next.<br />Also I had a question about the camo tables for your bo4 guns you currently have. Right now it&#39;s using the giant camo, bc I downloaded your camo. but do i need to make the camo tables myself for that like to change it into the ones I use on my other weapons? Because I have the other ones set to a standard black market camo.</p>

Also I wanted to ask if it&#39;s harder to port guns from bo4 to bo3, I know it could be a bit harder because it&#39;s still pretty close to launch day, but that&#39;s why I&#39;m asking if it&#39;s hard to port the bo4 guns to bo3. Also you probably hate requests and shit, I  get it. But if you&#39;re planning to port more of the bo4 guns, I would really love to see the strife pistol. But like I said, you probably hate requests for weapons. But just if you don&#39;t have any idea what to port next. Also I had a question about the camo tables for your bo4 guns you currently have. Right now it&#39;s using the giant camo, bc I downloaded your camo. but do i need to make the camo tables myself for that like to change it into the ones I use on my other weapons?

<p>Reply By: TheJaguarPlays<br />Because right now everyone has this problem and I want to help them out because offthegrid is just taking a time off, so if you wondered why the kn57 doesn&#39;t make sounds if you stop shooting, if you go into APE and search for the kn57 you need to look for the sounds and look for the <strong>fire end sound</strong>, it should say in the namespace something with fire_stop instead of fire_end.. so the only thing you have to do is change the word stop to end and then link and compile your map again and you fixed the sounds yourself :)<br /> <br />Hope you enjoy your time off grid, I love what you do! Thats&#39;s why I took a look myself xd</p>

I saw on the discord server other people not gonna say names, ported over things like wonder weapons. Will you be able to port things like the ray gun revolver thing in dead of the night for an example. Not that that is needed ofcourse just a question. I think that gun does not use any gsc so I think it would be possible tho xd<br /> <br />But it&#39;s really great that you started again on porting weapons :D</p>
