<p>Hello, I’m currently working on a weapon mod for the stock maps of bo3 and I got all of it together and are just about finished. However, I’ve ran into an issue where the sound effects for the weapons aren’t working on the maps. I feel like I’ve tried everything. I’ve tested the weapons on my custom test map and they work perfectly, but when I use the weapon on the Giant, everything works fine EXCEPT the sounds. I’m probably just missing something really obvious. Thanks!</p>

Thanks!<br /></blockquote>you need to copy the sound folder from a map<br /><br />Rename it zm_mod as it’ll have the maps name “eg zm_giant.scz”<br /><br />And add sound,zm_mod to your zone<br /><br />The sound folder doesn’t exist by default in a mod and without the line in zone it won’t even try to build your sounds so you had to have skipped that step so ofc you have no sounds</p>

I have the zm_factory.all, zm_factory_patch.all and zm_factory.en. Are these the folders I need?</p>

<p><blockquote>I see. Then I would use that sound folder for the weapon mod?<br /></blockquote>copy it from the map to your mod, and follow the instructions I gave - then yes, it will work<br /><br />Call the map zm_changeme <br />Go to blackops3/usermaps/zm_changeme<br />Get the sound folder<br />Copy it to your mods folder in zm<br />- and anywhere you see that in the files in the sound folder - or as the name of any files in the sound folder - change it to zm_mod<br /><br /><br />Or if it allows, just call the map zm_mod - copy paste the folder - done<br /><br /><br />And add to your zm_mod zone - sound,zm_mod</p>
