<p>Reply By: modric<br />Im exited for the new patch of weapons harry, but want to know if you will be changing anything with the staffs? Some things I have found- You can carry two at once which wasnt the case in origins. Non upgraded and upgraded versions do not hurt certain types of ai. I have some custom ai in my map and the only staff damage they take is a charged shot from an upgraded staff.</p>

Also harry is amazing at getting things to work properly so I was wondering if he could make the bows work with his pack, maybe a functioning upgrade and dragon system as well. It would add another layer of awesome to harry&#39;s already amazing pack :)</p>

<p>Reply By: FrozenDragon<br />Well I can see why the file was no longer available since harry was doing an update but jesus there is no need to be fucking rude to him all because he took his files down. I&#39;m getting abit impatient myself since I want to use them but I&#39;m not being a rude piece of shit about it.</p>
