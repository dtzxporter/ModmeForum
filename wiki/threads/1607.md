<p>Thread By: XxRaPiDK3LLERxX<br /><p style="text-align:left;">I recently ported MG08, I&#39;ve put the model, textures and animation of the weapon as well as weapon file. I saved it and placed it on my map in radiant, however, I can see it but when I launch the game into my map, it&#39;s not there.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Am I doing anything wrong?</p></p>
