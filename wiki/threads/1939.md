<p>Reply By: truman08<br />I&#39;m having the same problem with APE not loading but showing as a running process in the Task Manager. This issue started 2 or 3 weeks a go and I have been unable to complete my map ever since. I have tried the following fixes:<br /> <br />&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ending the process in task manager and starting the program manually form the execution file&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Starting the program in Administrator mode and various compatibility modes&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Verifying the game files on Steam&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Disabling my antivirus and firewall software&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ul&gt; <br />The only option I have left is to reinstall mod tools but I am wary of doing this due to the risk of further problems arising. I have backed everything up but I just have a bad feeling about reinstalling knowing that others have run into issues after reinstalling.<br /> <br />Did anybody find a fix for this issue other than the above or reinstalling mod tools?</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />this has always been a issue, just keep ending the process in task manager and try again, it works eventually<br /> <br />if not end mod tools and steam, and restart them<br /> <br />this is nothing new and you do not need to reinstall anything other than to waste your own time</p>

<p>Reply By: truman08<br />I hear you man but I have tried all of these suggestions several times without success, for hours at a time on occasion.<br /> <br />I know the issue has been around forever but I’ve always got it to work eventually (normally the second attempt). This time it just doesn’t want to open no matter what. <br /> <br />It’s just my luck that this happens when I was due to release the map I’ve spent the last 3-4 months working on. I really don’t know what else to do to at this point.</p>

This file may have corrupted during the crash, and it&#39;s safe to delete as re-running the launcher will generate a new cache file. It works for some errors. Again, you won&#39;t lose anything by deleting the file.&lt;/bo3root&gt;</p>

<p>Reply By: truman08<br />Thanks for your help guys but both of these suggestions haven&#39;t worked either.<br /> <br />I have found a user on Discord that had the very same issue a few months back. No matter what he tried to do, it just would not open the program. I have spoken to him and been advised that reinstalling mod tools was the only way that he could get it to work again.<br /> <br />I&#39;ve backed up all my custom files ready to put back in after the reinstall so hopefully all will be okay. I&#39;ll update this once I&#39;ve reinstalled with positive news I hope.</p>
