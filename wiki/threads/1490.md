<p>Thread By: ItalianMilkMan<br /><p style="text-align:left;">So im trying to port the call of the dead Skybox into Black ops 3 mod tools. The main skybox texture is on a 90 degree angle though. Ive tried flipping the texture, but it creates weird lines and other issues in the skybox. Ive also tried using the skybox model from BO1 and BO3, the texture still comes out wierd though. I was wondering if there is a proper method / tutorial for BO1 skybox&#39;s.<p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;"></p>Also, theres 3 different images for the skybox, the main skybox itself, and then two cloud textures. I cannot figure out how to get the two extra cloud textures into the skybox. I also have no idea what kind of additional settings I would need to give the two extra cloud textures.</p></p>
