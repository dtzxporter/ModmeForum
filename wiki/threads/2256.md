<p>Thread By: Zakkarof<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Hi,  I have made a remake of Cheese Cube By ZK, the original, I want to remake the Unlimited. But I need to know how to make a moving water who instant kill players when they go inside and who stop at the final door.

<p>Reply By: MoTivE<br />You can use a hurt trigger to damage players from the object browser but the parameters would have to be killed to instantly kill...As for the water you can just use a water texture applied to a brush/terrain patch. Ä° guess if it will be killing players instantly you do not need to also add the underwater element but that is possible too to add to the realism.</p>
