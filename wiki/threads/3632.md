<p>I&#39;m using <a href="https://forum.modme.co/threads/spawning-lots-of-zombies-with-a-trigger_multiple.3495/post-17875">eDeK&#39;s script</a> to try and make an area with many zombies but being inside the trigger does nothing. I don&#39;t know how to use trigger_multiple though so it might be a simple thing I&#39;m missing. Also I pasted the script at the end of my GSC if that matters. Any help appreciated<br /><br />Thanks</p>
