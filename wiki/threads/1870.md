<p>Thread By: MRFREAKYBWOY<br />Hi peeps,<br /> <br />Does anyone know the exact setting in the weapons csv that I need to set to stop a weapon from being able to pack a punch?<br /> <br />Basically I have the m2_flamethrower but when chucked in the PAP it doesnt come out, so I wanna disable it from being able to be upgraded.<br /> <br />Cheers</p>
