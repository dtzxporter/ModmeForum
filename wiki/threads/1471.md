<p>Thread By: SevenGPLuke<br />How does one change the melee sound for a weapon? I tried everything and nothing is working.  I changed what looked to be where to make the changes and still nothing. Help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.<br /><br /><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/29f0a4f2152ab43a00dbe095552c0d31.png"></p>
