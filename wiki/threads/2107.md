<p>Thread By: HEYOU<br />I&#39;ve never uploaded a map into the workshop. Everytime I try to upload any map I get this error: &quot;Error updating Steam workshop item. Error Code:&quot; I already deleted de .json file from the zone folder but yet I can&#39;t upload the map. Are there any other solutions?</p>
