<p>Thread By: SpeedBeam<br /><p style="text-align:left;">I really want to make true dual wield Model 1887s as a Pack-A-Punched variant for World at War, but I don&#39;t want sync ones that are super boring. I want ones that fully work, shoot left in this time and shoot right at this other time. OffTheWall cannot be found and I don&#39;t want to ask StuffyZombie because he might be busy. :/</p></p>
