<p>Thread By: Long Cut<br />Hey what&#39;s up? So, I have been working on an MW styled mod for BO3 MP and was wondering if anyone would be interested in joining me in working on the mod together as a team project. From what I&#39;ve seen, team projects always seem to do really well so I figure why not give it a shot and see what we can come up with! It would be a good learning experience and we could share assets as well. If you are interested, hit me up and we can work something out! Please have some prior experience with the mod tools and be ready to have lengthy conversations at times over Discord.<br />Thanks!</p>
