<p>Hey all,<br /><br />Anyone know why there are splotchy shadows in this lighting? What i mean is when you look at the walls in the picture, there are just splotches of shadows. I dont know why, and Ive adjusted the bounce count and what not and nothing has worked so far. If anyone has a solution, please let me know.<br /><br />Regards,<br />the_bibba_boy<br /><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.632.jpg' | relative_url }}"></p>

<p>im guessing your probe is huge. use more probes or make the resolution higher</p>

<p><blockquote>im guessing your probe is huge. use more probes or make the resolution higher<br /></blockquote><br />I fixed the issue, all i had to do was lower the resolution down to .25x. It completely gets rid of the splotchy shadows and it doesnt affect the probes reflection at all. Thanks for your reply though.</p>
