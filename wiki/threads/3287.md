<p>Does anyone have a link to any sort of weapons ported from MW 2019?  I try to go to Skye&#39;s post, but all the limks are dead because he selfishly only allows their friends to use them.  And I really want to use them.</p>

<p>He&#39;s not being selfish, they&#39;ve just downloaded them before the link was down. Then a tip would be, download things before hand before links will be deleted. Also don&#39;t be an ass and telling lies, just wait like everyone else now :3</p>

<p>You join a public forum to ask for illegally ripped content and tell the guy he&#39;s selfish for not sharing them. Rightio. Good luck finding your guns or getting any sort of help.</p>
