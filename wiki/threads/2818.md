<p><blockquote>bigdog those are in harrys pack w one inch punch and staffs.

And either way I highly doubt you would want the wave gun/zap guns to kill him</p>

<p>I ran into the same errors everyone else did after following the instructions to the letter. I thenq tried to comment out the qed and that seemed to work (or at least kind of) but then I get about 100 errors for the weapon models and materials (yes I added both downloads to my root) no matter what. I am not a coder at all so sorting this out is beyond my skill set.<br />It would be nice if these were separated and able to be downloaded one at a time. I only want the Ray Gun MK2 and the Gersch Device, and having allllllll that other code that is not part of my mod really clutters up my script.<br />For now I have to uninstall but I will look back at the post in a while and see what happens. Maybe a youtube video could help idk.</p>

<p>[QUOTE=&quot;[ Edicius ], post: 14259, member: 91&quot;]<br />I ran into the same errors everyone else did after following the instructions to the letter. I thenq tried to comment out the qed and that seemed to work (or at least kind of) but then I get about 100 errors for the weapon models and materials (yes I added both downloads to my root) no matter what. I am not a coder at all so sorting this out is beyond my skill set.<br />It would be nice if these were separated and able to be downloaded one at a time. I only want the Ray Gun MK2 and the Gersch Device, and having allllllll that other code that is not part of my mod really clutters up my script.<br />For now I have to uninstall but I will look back at the post in a while and see what happens. Maybe a youtube video could help idk.<br />[/QUOTE]<br />Im working to optimize the scripts with others see if we can solve this so it works as easy as possible, anyways will make a video once its completed</p>
