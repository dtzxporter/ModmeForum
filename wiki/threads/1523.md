<p>Thread By: vampehtwist<br />When making a map I know about adding clips to objects and stuff however, I have some models I have added from <a href="mailto:w@w">w@w</a> to bo3 which is used in a mod not a map and I can&#39;t seem to make them so player&#39;s can&#39;t walk through them. Is there any tutorials or anyone know how to make an object solid through APE or GSC scripting?</p>

<p>Reply By: Wild<br />I could be wrong but I am pretty sure you need to make a collmap for the model and set it up in APE. How you do it I have no idea but hopefully that points you in the right direction.</p>

That helps me out too since I&#39;ve been learning how to model recently. Just some extra knowledge that could be useful lol.</p>
