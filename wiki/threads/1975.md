<p>Thread By: simplyzak09<br />Hi, I&#39;m in the progress of making a new <br />    I&#39;m in the progress of making a new zombies map and I wanted to add a bus that the player can claim on while also having zombies claim onto the bus to chase after the player. <br />so I added in a traversal and even followed youtube tutorials to make sure they are set up properly but I can&#39;t get them to work.<br /> <br />The zombies just walk into the area where the traversal is but they run on the spot, I have tried this on walls and models and again watched youtube tutorials. I can even play the animation that shows its set up right and should all be working but it doesn&#39;t, does anyone know how I can fix this? <br /> <br /> <iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u3hb3Kg" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /> <br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j2qNhvF" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /> <br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mgfftI5" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /> <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://imgur.com/u3hb3Kg"><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://imgur.com/j2qNhvF"><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://imgur.com/mgfftI5"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://imgur.com/j2qNhvF"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://imgur.com/mgfftI5"></p>

<p>Reply By: Wild<br />Are you using the traversals from JBird&#39;s videos? If so then make sure you&#39;re using the new updated ones because the first video he made about traversals, well those are broken now. If you&#39;re already using the updated ones make sure you add the new zombie actor with the correct KVP&#39;s and delete the original zombie actor. If that doesn&#39;t work or you arn&#39;t using the traversals from JBird then I am not sure :/</p>
