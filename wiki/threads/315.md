<p>Thread By: SwisherFisher<br /><p style="text-align:left;">So I finished making a map like a week ago and decided I wanted to make it larger. I added a jump pad to make you fly to another area on the map and when I get to that new area the zombies spawn, but don&#39;t move much. The only thing the zombies do is break down the boards on the window, but don&#39;t attack me for some reason. They just stand there all confused. I made sure the zombie model thing wasn&#39;t close to them and made sure the zones were connected. Not sure how to fix this issue, wondering if anyone could help me out, thank you. </p></p>
