<p>CSG extract doesn&#39;t work on meshes.. But you can use a mesh to cut a hole in a brush.. (cylinder for example)<br />But to do a hole in a patch, you need to splice the mesh at the vertices. <br />Press V to enter vertices mode.<br />Select 2 vertices in one line in either 2D or 3D view. If you can&#39;t see the vertices, press F9<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.534.png' | relative_url }}"><br /> then press ctrl, shift and X<br />A split line will appear on the mesh in 3D mode (Split lines only appear on brushes in 2D)<br />Do the same to work around where you want want the hole. Work in a clockwise direction ---&gt; until you&#39;ve split 4 sides of the hole. Add\remove\move vertices until you get the desired result.<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.535.png' | relative_url }}"><br /><br />If 2 vertices get too far apart, hilight the first one where you want to join to, then the second one you&#39;re joining..and press W to weld them back together.<br />Hope this helps.</p>
