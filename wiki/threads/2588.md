<p>I&#39;ve used this guide for reference; <a href="https://wiki.modme.co/wiki/black_ops_3/intermediate/Setting-Up-Loadscreen-Videos.html">https://wiki.modme.co/wiki/black_ops_3/intermediate/Setting-Up-Loadscreen-Videos.html</a><br />(and set output format to MKV at 1280x720p @ 30fps, with H.264 encoding and removed any audio and subtitle tracks)<br /><br />But whenever I try load into my map, the game appears to try load the cutscene but flashes the command line for a split second then crashes to desktop. Happens when I load from launcher or from within the game. Any ideas? (If needed, the cutscene I&#39;m trying to use is Treyarch.bik from WaW)<br /><br />EDIT: VLC is able to play the MKV cutscene perfectly fine, only Bo3 crashes with it. Could it possibly be an encoding used in WaW that&#39;s somehow transferred itself with during the conversion to MKV maybe? Idk lol</p>

<p>If you used handbrake did you actually remove the hidden audio track that appears?<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.10.png' | relative_url }}"><br /><br />It&#39;s in this tab, remove and clear all of them before exporting...</p>

<p>To see if it&#39;s the video or the mod, take one of the stock bo3 mkvs and copy / rename it to yours, build and see if the game still crashs to rule out the video.</p>

<p><blockquote>To see if it&#39;s the video or the mod, take one of the stock bo3 mkvs and copy / rename it to yours, build and see if the game still crashs to rule out the video.<br /></blockquote><br />Aight, I tested the Nuk3town cutscene which worked completely fine. Odd - I&#39;m not really sure what could be wrong with the video I&#39;ve been trying to use<br /><br />Edit; here&#39;s the info of the custom cutscene according to VLC:<br /> <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/fd4e02d36b286dbe794e03f6a8dba9b0.png"></p>

<p>So I put the Nuk3town outro through Handbrake and tried it as a cutscene after that, which then caused the game to start crashing to desktop with the Nuk3town cutscene. So it&#39;s probably something I&#39;ve done wrong in Handbrake, but I&#39;ve no idea what (Have got no audio tracks, no subtitle tracks, H264, etc...)<br /><br />Here&#39;s the general settings I&#39;ve been using (also attempted using presets Fast 720p30, Fast 1080p30, H.264 MKV 1080p30, removing filters also did nothing):<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/02c1a5648999548fa7491e713da650cd.png"></p>

<p>One more test <a href="https://mega.nz/#!5I4BSSDI!_ByPz2LvJU41gmlxImtwYCMZzWwvlj9Rr5bjXpzbZVE">https://mega.nz/#!5I4BSSDI!_ByPz2LvJU41gmlxImtwYCMZzWwvlj9Rr5bjXpzbZVE</a></p>

I also downgraded to v1.0.0 of HandBrake and then processed the Treyarch.bik, which then worked in Bo3 completely fine. I guess this can now be considered solved, it&#39;s some form of encoding quirk I suppose with newer versions of HandBrake which Bo3 can&#39;t handle (Thanks for helping to get to the bottom of this btw)</p>

<p>Yeah, I&#39;ll explicitly link a compatible version in the tutorial.</p>
