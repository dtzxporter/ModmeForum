<p>Thread By: Erneld<br />I can&#39;t seem to play the &quot;zm_giant&quot; map that is provided in the mod tools. I had made a copy of it by &quot;Save As&quot; and naming it an existing mod map, so I could easily mod it. After trying to compile, I would get an error after rendering the lighting, and when I tried running the map, it would say that it couldn&#39;t read the fastfile. When I tried rendering the lighting (and altering nothing else) on the clean version of &quot;zm_giant&quot; and compiling, I would get the same error. <br /> <br />&quot;Probe at -618.01 -1258.81 127.58 out of range. Color 3.35 0.40 0.00 exposure 0.01&quot;<br /> <br />I wasn&#39;t able to run that map either. This is the clean base of the zombie map that 3arch provided, and I can&#39;t get it to work, but I&#39;ve been able to get a test map I created to work no problem. I also got this error for probes #0 through #143:<br /> <br />&quot;#0: -105.54, 408.50, 139.00 Lightstate 1 Probe #0: -1179.00, -646.50, 709.50(Global) Reflection cube maps missing from probe!<br />Volume #0: -105.54, 408.50, 139.00 Lightstate 1 Probe #0: -1179.00, -646.50, 709.50(Global) Probe missing X GI data.<br />Volume #0: -105.54, 408.50, 139.00 Lightstate 1 Probe #0: -1179.00, -646.50, 709.50(Global) Probe missing Y GI data.<br />Volume #0: -105.54, 408.50, 139.00 Lightstate 1 Probe #0: -1179.00, -646.50, 709.50(Global) Probe missing Z GI data.<br />Volume #0: -105.54, 408.50, 139.00 Lightstate 1 Probe #1: 255.56, -2085.81, 350.42 Reflection cube maps missing from probe!<br />Volume #0: -105.54, 408.50, 139.00 Lightstate 1 Probe #1: 255.56, -2085.81, 350.42 Probe missing X GI data.<br />Volume #0: -105.54, 408.50, 139.00 Lightstate 1 Probe #1: 255.56, -2085.81, 350.42 Probe missing Y GI data.<br />Volume #0: -105.54, 408.50, 139.00 Lightstate 1 Probe #1: 255.56, -2085.81, 350.42 Probe missing Z GI data.&quot;<br /> <br />This is strange, and pissing me off. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Reply By: Slayinartz<br />well this is super old but you didnt compile the map, hence why you got the &quot;couldnt read fastfile error&quot;, and building lighting is extremely taxing on potato pcs especially on the giant<br />and to mod it, you dont even need to compile it, just make a mod</p>
