<p>Thread By: akagraffiti<br />Re-download If Downloaded Before 4/14/17<br /><br />Hey whats up guys. This is a magic box i&#39;ve been working on sense beta tools came out. Will be having more drag, and drop files like this one, but those will be the other treyarch boxs. Also we will be updating these files until we get them exactly like the originals so check up for updates weekly. These have a few effects on them. Will be adding more as soon as I can get time to create them. This is a part 1 on my channel of a 3 part series. This one is just giving u guys my version of the box. In part 2 I will explain how to port it over yourself, and in part 3 I will explain zbarriers, and how to set up a custom box or have multiple magic boxs in your map at the same time. So that&#39;s all. If you guys could please credit me, and uptownpapi25 when you use are versions of are boxs in your map. We would be thankful, and would be greatly appreciated as we have put alot of effort in to these. If you really love us you can drop a sub on are channels or if you just want some awesome tutorials like this one or you want to see those other parts to this series!?

Nothing should of changed though, and other people have downloaded this, and it works fine for them. If you stamped it first, and it did not work try adding it with out stamping.</p>

<p>Reply By: ii R3cKYOuRSOul x<br /><blockquote><em>coxinator115</em><br />Active your zone? What do you mean and how do i do it?  </blockquote><br /> Open your doors<br /> <br />You have Start_zone, zone1, zone2, zone3, zone4. Lets say your mystery box is in zone2 and you are in start_zone, open the door to active zone2 and open the door to active zone2 [which is where your mystery box is].</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />stamping it wouldnt help i really dont get why people keep saying that<br /> <br />if anything itll make things &quot;worse&quot; most of the time as it removes the &quot;target&quot; kvp and posssibly others<br /> <br />sounds like the struct is missing, but the &quot;zbarrier&quot; is there</p>

Then he should, because the kvps might be missing like i said. It is a struct, and a zbarrier, but the struct should be there even if he stamped it.</p>
