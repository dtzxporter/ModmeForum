<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />Blackout appears to be very ambitious, a quality you don&#39;t always see in Call of Duty anymore. I&#39;m sure Blackout will receive a lot of hate for caving in to the trendy &quot;Battle Royale&quot; genre, but I do think Call of Duty will able to put a unique spin on the battle royale genre that is warranted.<br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BjiaMBk6rHk" frameborder="0"></iframe><br />Just watching this video got me very hyped, which is pretty rare for me. I love the fact that they are mixing MP, Zombies, and previous Campaign features into it. At this stage, (on what, the 15th game?) Call of Duty has stockpiled a lot of potentially useful assets, allowing them to complete such an ambitious project in only 3 years.<br /> <br />Now obviously just because you have a lot of interesting features, and that its large scale, doesn&#39;t mean it will be a success. Just look at Tranzit, Zetsubou no Shima, and Moon. All 3 of those I would argue have some of the most interesting and ambitious features compared other zombie maps, but people still hated them. So obviously just because they show a lot of cool shit in the trailers doesn&#39;t mean the gameplay will actually be good.<br /> <br />I&#39;m looking forward to Blackout, and I&#39;m glad they didn&#39;t make a campaign instead. If you ask me, a lot of effort was wasted trying to make good campaigns in later CODs, that just did not turn out great.</p>
