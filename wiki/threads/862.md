<p>Thread By: MJPW<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Hi I&#39;ve tried various ways toward applying the map&#39;s Pack-a-Punch camo on custom weapons ported into the map but with no successful results. The Pack-a-Punch camo Im using for the map is the Ice camo (or #43). Also if I made a custom Pack-a-Punch camo how would I go about applying it to all of the standard weapons? </p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">Thank you :)</p></p>

But if I wanted to make a custom material (pap camo) and apply it to the other weapons how could I do that?</p></p>
