<p>Thread By: belly3031<br />I&#39;m importing a custom model that I&#39;ve created in Maya and when I try setting it up in APE it just stays as the checkered box and says &quot;XModel &quot;chest&quot; Failed. Failed loading Xmodel file &quot;bin file location&quot;.<br />I&#39;ve converted it in Kronos as a BIN file, I&#39;ve tried lowering the poly count and removing the textures and even have tried different models. Everything I try doesn&#39;t seem to work.<br />If anyone could help that&#39;d be awesome :)</p>

You can also try ExportX from here (which is pretty much the only converter you&#39;ll need):<br /> <br /><a href="http://phabricator.aviacreations.com/w/apps/exportx/">http://phabricator.aviacreations.com/w/apps/exportx/</a></p>
