<p>Thread By: inktrocity<br />I&#39;ve seen videos and images alike with additional maya perspective views FirstPerson90 and 45 (I think), but I cannot find them anywhere on the forum. Are they part of a tool in the creations forum? Is it just a custom image plane in maya?<br /> <br />Thanks :)</p>
