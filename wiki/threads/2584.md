You need to learn how to paint and adjust weights in Maya. The easiest way to test them before going into the game is to import an animation onto the rig in Maya to test it.</p>

<p><blockquote>still looking for help.<br /></blockquote><br />If you want the simple way, you can find the name of the xmodel for each character using Wraith/Greyhound and then, rename your custom xmodels as the in-game ones, and add the names to the zone file.<br /><br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
xmodel,&lt;name_found&gt;
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br />This will override the existing in-game model with yours if you name them the same...</p>
