Was seeking a better way without changing the doorway itself or zombies running through the wall.</p>

A doorway of 96hx56w should have little issues with pathing, even with larger groups of zombies, check Scale_Standards.pdf in docs folder for more info:<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/RbftwDg.png"></p>

Either way though, if I end up needing to try out these pathnodes, do I just make the bottom of the node essentially even with the ground? Then is there any need to mess with any KVPs or anything with them?</p>
