<p>Hello,<br /><br />I want to disable a perk from being turned on by the power switch in game. What can I change in the scripts for me to do that? I already know about Symbos &quot;local power&quot;, but I have electrical devices that wont work with symbos local power, so Im putting in another switch to turn those on. Even with the local power set to some perks, when I flip the second switch, the perks still go on, which I dont want. I only want the non local power perks and other electrical devices to go on by the second switch, not EVERYTHING. Thanks!</p>
