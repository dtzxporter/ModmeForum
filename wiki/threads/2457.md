<p>Reply By: Gash<br />Having an issue with getting this to load. Ive followed the posts instructions but everytime i try to load the actual script it comes up with an error relating to a syntax error which reads to the &quot;python(&quot;import oneclickdoesplenty&quot;);&quot; line which is placed in the usersetup.mel. The only other scripts I have are the COD Maya Tools and the Sea anims, and ive tried loading it without the other scripts along with other variations (e.g. OCDP + CMT or OCDP + SA) but it still didnt change anything. Any idea on why this error is occurring?</p>

<p>Reply By: Scobalula<br />The script has been updated to work with SETools 2.0 and is now a thousand times faster and you no longer will have to be annoyed with it constantly reopening the scene. :D<br /> <br />Make sure to download the script and replace the py and delete the pyc file and restart Maya.</p>

<p>Reply By: Scobalula<br />An update has been released. <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://aviacreations.com/modme/emoticons/smile.png"><br /> <br />Fixes:<br />* Fixed errors with selecting joints when porting BO3 --&gt; BO3.<br />* Fixed notetracks being added constantly.<br />* Fixed other misc. errors/glitches.<br /> <br />Additions:<br />+ Added experimental support for Infinite Warfare with Azsry&#39;s Rig<br />+ Added Purge Namespace button to remove all but t7: namespaces.<br />+ Added button to remove prefixes from materials like mo_, mc_, etc. (Though I think Porter addressed this in W4, regardless it was easy to add ^^)<br /> <br />Please read the new instructions in the readme in the scripts folder as this is now installed as a plug-in so I can bypass any issues using cmds.file() with Maya and call SETool&#39;s import func. directly. <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://aviacreations.com/modme/emoticons/wink.png"><br /> <br /><strong>Please report any issues you may have.</strong> <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://aviacreations.com/modme/emoticons/happy.png"></p>

<p>Reply By: Ducky<br />Few questions:<br /> <br /><ul><li>Do anims have to be in SEAnim format?<br /><br /><li>Are ADS anims exported how you would manually (by putting them on top of the idle anim)?<br /><br /><li>Should the rig be renamed to have _t7 after everything before running the export?<br /><br /></li></li></li></ul></p>

Are ADS anims exported how you would manually (by putting them on top of the idle anim)? Should the rig be renamed to have _t7 after everything before running the export?</blockquote><br /> <br />Well I think I answered some of these on Mod Tools Discord but for others who view the thread:<br /> <br /><ul><li>Technically yes, but the function can be modified to load others, if you&#39;re asking about .tanims then you can try modifying it and have it reload scene like I done originally.<br /><br /><li>You don&#39;t need to pull on the idle anim for ads anims, the only joints most ads anims animate is tag_ads and tag_torso depending on game. Importing idle is simply to see how it looks in Maya before it goes in-game.<br /><br /><li>No, this is a requirement for some rigs if you&#39;re using tanims, since Tom&#39;s plugin seems to ignore namespaces you need to rename them otherwise it attempts to animate the t7: namespace.<br /><br /></li></li></li></ul></p>

<p>Reply By: Nelonn<br />Thanks a lot for this amazing tool, but i have problems with sprint in,loop and out anims. They are not working in game, but everything seems normal in maya.<br />As I remember that you have to do a trick with dragging idle anim before importing sprint anims... Somebody correct me if i&#39;m wrong.<br />P.S. Forgot to mention its the iw7 sprint anims.</p>

Some optimizations, and code is more clear if you want to modifiy it hopefully.</p>

<p>Reply By: Scobalula<br /><blockquote><em>Khel Mho</em><br />can you add supported .tanims from tom tools? thank you </blockquote><br /> <br />Wraith supports every game Lemon/Lime supports so there are no plans to ever add tanim support, not to mention it&#39;s not as simple as it would require more code to handle reloading the scene and renaming the _t7 joints, where as with SEAnims we can import them without reloading the scene and it doesn&#39;t ignore namespaces (unless the joint straight up doesn&#39;t exist then it goes for *:).</p>

<p>Reply By: JellyAlex<br />The latest version of OCDP and CodMayaTools doesnt export notetracks. On line 445, it throws: <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
global name &#39;ReadXanimNotes&#39; is not defined
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
It seems in CodMayaTools.py the function ReadXanimNotes(0) has been changed to {% highlight php %}{% raw %}
ReadNotetracks(windowID) 
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
however when changing line 445 to {% highlight php %}{% raw %}
ReadNotetracks(&#39;xanim&#39;)
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
it still doesn&#39;t export notes. In your next version could you please fix this error?<br /> <br />Thanks</p>
