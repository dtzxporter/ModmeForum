<p>Have alot of zones setup that work with spawners and all, but 1 zone doesnt. When activating the zone by buying a door it lets me move around ( without samantha laughing and killing me ) but the zombies just dont spawn in that zone. They do spawn in adjacent zones. Ive been trying to fix this for a few days and I have no idea what the problem could be</p>

If they&#39;re barrier spawners make sure the script string on the spawner is the same as on the window</p>

<p>You mean spawn points not spawners right<br /><br />should have one spawner - lots of spawn points ( which are structs )</p>
