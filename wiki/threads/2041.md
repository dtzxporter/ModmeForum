I remember that happens when you’re using zm_usermap actors but when using zm_factory actors their head comes off when performing headshots.<br /> <br />What zombies actors you got in your map at the moment?<br />Im not sure if there even is a setting on weapon file to change the ability to detach zombie’s head when performing headshots.</p>
