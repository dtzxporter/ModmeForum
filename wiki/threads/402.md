<p>Thread By: DarkCry9000<br />As the title says, my radiant stops responding all together when loading up my map. Very little has changed between last load and this one, no scripts have been changed, and I have tried back ups. I can&#39;t get it to open at all. Radiant black opens and looks like it&#39;s loading but the bar never moves. I get that sometimes it takes a while but it always shows what its working on or some progress, this has nothing. Ive left it for 30 mins and still no progress. Is this a memory leak or something or what could cause this? Anyone have something similair?</p>

<p>Reply By: Exofile<br />When you say &lt;em&gt;very little has changed between last load and this one &lt;/em&gt;, what exactly is it you&#39;ve changed?</p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />maybe you have an empty prefab in your map (a prefab with nothing in it)</p>

<p>Reply By: DarkCry9000<br />When I say very little I mean all I really did was add some clip and a terrain patch. Also, to the other question, can an empty prefab cause this problem? I have tried loading a previous autosave up to a day before this problem even occurred yet it still does not work. I don&#39;t think it is something in the .map file?</p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />a previous version won&#39;t help you if a empty prefab is in it. and yes empty prefabs crash your map</p>
