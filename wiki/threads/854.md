<p>Reply By: Wild<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Open up the weapon&#39;s GDT in APE and click on the weapon file for the upgraded version. Scroll down until you find the section that says &quot;Camo&quot; and next to it paste &quot;camo_t7_tgcamo_standard_dlc1_base76&quot;. That should fix it. Any ported weapon I download that the camo doesn&#39;t work I just do that and it ends up working fine.</p></p>
