<p>Thread By: alienedits<br />I was wondering if it would be possible to have multiple teleporters that could run with the power off, and take you to the mainframe without linking it. Also want to know how I could make it cost 500 points per use.</p>

<p>Reply By: Exofile<br />Just out of curiosity, how do you plan on having it seem logical? Having teleporters work without the power on, what&#39;s your method of having them be &quot;useable&quot; in the sense of logistical thinking?</p>

Basically needing to teleport to get to power</p>

If your map is large and teleporting is an ideal way to travel, you are going to want to have zombies either teleport with you or die and respawn near your new position. Simply teleporting will not be a good solution</p>

Think about it, if I was getting overwhelmed I could simply just run into the new zone and kill off all the zombies chasing me. Even if they respawn it could still be an issue. The reason it worked so well in GK is because you moved entirely to a new place that was a large distance from the original zombies.</p>
