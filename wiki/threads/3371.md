<p>I’m making a zombie map similar to poop of the dead, where all your things come from buying a power up. (Guns, perks, pap, etc.)<br /><br />I want to add perks like PhD, Who’s Who, and maybe BO4 and Custom Perks, but I want to know how you put them in with the other perks so you can get them when you get the random perk bottle just like poop of the dead.</p>
