<p>Reply By: XxRaPiDK3LLERxX<br />You probably have a bad sector on your hard drive, that file might be on that bad sector (FYI Bad sectors can happen for many different reasons but I&#39;d always recommend backing things up as it could make things worse).<br />If Windows can repair it then great if not then your hard drive has been damaged. This happened to me quite some time ago.</p>
