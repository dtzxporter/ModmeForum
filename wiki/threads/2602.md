<p>(Ports continued, OP was too big)<br /><br />Ray Gun Mark II (Black Ops 3 - ZC)<br /><br />
Ray Gun Mark II ported from BO3 ZC to BO3 ZM:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/4b10ca8f93e064dd1ba1629a48061932.gif"><br /><br />Weapon Features:<br />- Full Mark 2 Functionality: Projectiles penetrate multiple zombies, Deal correct damage with headshot multipliers - Gibs etc<br />- Full set of FX created from scratch by me, I tried to get them as close to official as possible<br />- All official sounds<br />- Should work against every enemy type, only tested against dogs though (Some Mark 2 ports didn&#39;t damage Parasites for example)<br />- PAP Version - With correct red glow on the weapon<br />- PAP Version works with all stock BO3 camos chosen in script<br />- All official anims, crawling and sliding included<br />- Omitted from Double PAP<br /><br />Note: The weapon is set up using the same line as the Mark 1 used, so it is defined as special, but I&#39;m unsure how else this affects it, I have not set anything up to limit it to 1 player or prevent holding the Mark 1 and 2 at the same time, as far as I know that would require scripting, so if you want something like this, consult a scripter. This is just the weapon port.<br /><br />Weapon Download:<br /><a href="https://mega.nz/#!qF8hzZIY!gcnm72LJw4YxQAjpirB7OtQZ4MYPa2oU-Ad2_ca7PqI">Download</a>

<p>I downloaded the ak74u and the wallbuy doesn&#39;t seem to work. It displays the wallbuy and says &quot;press F to pick up&quot; but there&#39;s no price despite me setting one in the weapons pool. along with that the sounds for the ak74u nor the m1911 seem to not work either. I&#39;m completely new to zombie modding; help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>So, I honestly have no idea what I&#39;ve done wrong all the files are correct as per the instructions but whenever I go to upgrade the weapon it doesnt give me the option on PAP. It doesnt matter which gun it is either. It&#39;s very annoying because the upgraded gun IS in the map but for some reason it&#39;s not letting me use it on PAP. <br /><br />This link is a Imgur post showing gifs of what I am talking about. I hope somebody legit sees this :(<br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a/dc6jk78" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

<p>Hello! I was planning on using your Ray Gun rework in a quality of life improvements mod. I have been doing some testing and found that the pap camo doesn&#39;t seem to work on Ascension or Origins. Is there any specific way I can fix that maybe in the .gdt? I&#39;m fairly new to modding</p>

<p><blockquote>I have exactly the same problem, did you find any fix?<br /></blockquote><br />I had this same problem and it turns out the Pack-A-Punch prefab I was using wasn&#39;t compatible for whatever reason. If you happened to use HarryBo21&#39;s perk pack (or a similar one) that came with a Pack-A-Punch prefab... get rid of it. Just use the default prefab in the &quot;zm_core&quot; folder.</p>

<p><blockquote>Literally has fuck all to do with anything<br /></blockquote><br />You&#39;re right, it does have fuck all to do with anything. For some reason, it worked when I switched prefabs. But I just switched back and it works fine. I apologize.<br />I&#39;m pretty new to scripting and modding in general, still have a lot to learn. (Thank you by the way, I&#39;ve noticed from a bunch of different threads on multiple sites that you&#39;ve done A LOT of work for this community.)</p>

<p><blockquote>Does anybody know how to replace the starting pistol with the m1911 from here?<br /></blockquote><br />level.start_weapon = getWeapon( “your weapon name” );<br /><br />After usermap::main(); in your map gsc<br /><br />The idea is to answer on the topics so others see the answer too</p>
