<p>Thread By: xReaction<br />hello all, I have a map that im working on. It includes going from building to building. What i cannot do is allow the zombies to follow the player, so i was wondering if it&#39;s possible to kill zombies when i go from one place to another. Kind of like going down the elevator in five, the zombies teleport to that level. can anyone help? thanks in advanced</p>
