<p>Thread By: adamk570<br />So far the only way I have found to increase the thickness of fog is to duplicate the layer itself. Is there a cleaner/faster way of doing this?</p>

It&#39;s default is 0.75 for zm_factory_afog.</p>

<p>Reply By: Fil he Modder<br />if you drag a volume litfog into the map, set it to factory volumetric, and set the colour inbetween black and white, it&#39;ll become thicker</p>
