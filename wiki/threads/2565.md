<p>Hey guys! Thank you for checking out my post on weapon ports to BO3 Zombies!<br /><br />These are all my weapons I&#39;ve worked on for some time now and I figure the public should now enjoy<br /><br />If you have questions, suggestions, or need help, you can post here, or you can get to me faster on Discord @ TheSkyeLord#2511<br /><br />Also, you may need to add this below to the zone file of your map (located @ BO3 root/usermaps/mapname/zone_source/mapname.zone)<br /><br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}

If you look in the weapon pack in APE the model is actually fully set up. Just no anims or weapon files.</p>

<p>Hi Skye, I have a question:<br />How can I use my PaP cammo for some weapons?<br />I already change the &quot;base 136&quot; and works fine with some weapons like WW2, but not with BO2, BO4 and others</p>

<p>been playing around with these a lot! Really great work, and good job man! But are you going to be doing Newer varients of the guns that have been added? ( Chronicles Raygun Mark 2, or the most recent raygun Mark 2 from alpha omega, I tried finding the files with greyhound and it just seems to be a giant mess and can’t get my head around it lol.</p>

As for sounds, the issue you may be having is simply a sound error in the linker.</p>

I am new to map making, sorry if these are dumb questions xD.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />For sound errors, the most common ones you&#39;ll see are &quot;missing source checksum&quot; and &quot;object not set to instance of object.&quot; Those are fixed by literally just relinking till they don&#39;t show. And you&#39;re all good. if you wanna message more on this, please message me on Discord @ TheSkyeLord#2511.</p>

That error can be caused by a sound linker error. Usually has “missing source checksum” or “reference not set to instance of object.” These don’t mean anything in particular, but it stops any new sounds from being added to the map.</p>

The weapons limit (one gun, including base and pack a punched bersion) is about 150. The raw weapons limit (as per engine) is 1536, with only ~40% or so left for us to use. As by &quot;deleting&quot; some weapons from a specific map, the best thing is to remove the weapon,weaponname call from the .zone file and check that there&#39;s no wallbuy prefab still present in the map (if, the gun has a wallbuy present in said map).

The issue you’re having is there’s simply too many weapons loading in at once. A good rule of thumb to stick by is a max of roughly 3 of my weapons packs, or a max of 150 custom (not in the default tools) weapons.</p>

The folders that are included go into the BO3 root folder (at Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops III). The folders you&#39;ll end up dragging in will be model_export, share, sound_assets, sorce_data, and xanim_export (if I remember off the top of my head correctly).</p>

You won’t use skye_up_camo at all. Due to the new camo mask/camo table method I’m using, you’ll have to input the custom camo per gun, under it’s own custom_base136 entry</p>

<p><blockquote>Everytime I add more of your weapons it takes very long time whenever I try to testing my map. &#128543;<br /></blockquote><br />Hey Justin! Smasher is correct, whenever you add anything (my weapon ports included) to a map, it has to convert them. Which can take a while, especially if adding one of my packs. Thanks!</p>

<p><blockquote>Glad to hear they are going well do you think you will ever port cod world at war weapons?<br /></blockquote><br />Hey man! I do eventually plan to do WaW (and maybe original CoD 4 weapons) down the road, though it would be at a much later time. As Harry said, they do look considerably worse than the newer games, but I also do understand that some do like the 100% original, from those games weapons themselves. Thanks!</p>

<p><blockquote>I shall tell you I directly told him in Discord and he simply put it off, he&#39;ll only help out his friends.<br /></blockquote><br />Who are these “friends” you keep referencing? You are throwing a hissy fit because you weren’t fast enough to grab ports. Maybe if you understood how long it takes to actually port a MW19 weapon, and the actual reason he took the ports down (which is to fix animations and sounds), you would show more sympathy. People like you constantly complaining about stuff being taken down and being disrespectful are why people leave this community.</p>

<p><blockquote>is it possible to rename the PaP guns?<br /></blockquote><br />Yes, it is. You have to go into Call of Duty Black Ops III/source_data/ and look for something like skye_iw4_g18. Open that file and use the search feature on your text editor program. Search for &quot;displayName&quot; and keep searching that until it displays the pap name.</p>
