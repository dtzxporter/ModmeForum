<p>Small update for anybody who&#39;s keeping up with this! I am working on some big things for these weapons, and I&#39;ll be releasing them as I finish them, starting with pistols, which will include a slight rework to the 44 magnum and some additions to it as well so keep your eyes posted! (Hint, dual wields ;))</p>
