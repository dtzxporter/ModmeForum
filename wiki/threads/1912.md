<p>Thread By: PrestigeZombies<br />So I&#39;ve created a map called &#39;Spuddley&#39;s Warehouse&#39; for a youtuber named spuddley, its going great, the only problem i have is that i don&#39;t know how to script or make a boss fight. So i was wondering if anyone would be interested in taking part help creating this map by making and scripting a boss fight. This would mean A LOT to me! Spuddley would also appreciate it too. If any one can help out making and scripting... PLEASE let me know. You will also be put into the map credits meaning that spuddley will shout you out. Much appreciated<br /> <br />-PrestigeZombies</p>
