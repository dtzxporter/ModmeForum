<p>Reply By: MyNameIsNobody<br />Guys this is f***ing awesome, but after adding it to my map I can no longer use Harry&#39;s Tomahawks (retriever/redeemer from MOTD). When I pick them up now, I cant throw them at all. So anyone who wants both in their map may be SOL (unless the problem is somehow unrelated). Unfortunately the retriever/redeemer are crucial at points of my map so I will have to uninstall this :( but its perfect for my RuneScape &amp; LOTR maps I&#39;m going to make in the future!</p>

<p>Reply By: MyNameIsNobody<br />Well, the second I changed give_at_start to false, they worked again. Changed it back to give_at_start true, Once again I can&#39;t use the tomahawks after picking them up. <br /> <br />EDIT: SO WHAT IS GOING ON IS IF I PICK UP THE TOMAHAWK WHILE GIVE AT START IS SET TO TRUE, I STILL HAVE THE DRAGON BOMB INSTEAD OF THE TOMAHAWK. FIGURED THIS OUT AFTER GETTING MAX AMMO AND ATTEMPTING TO THROW THE TOMAHAWKS AFTERWARD. SO IT SHOWS UP AS BEING THE TOMAHAWK, BUT I REALLY HAVE THE D BOMBS STILL. IS THE DRAGON BOMB AUTOMATICALLY IN THE BOX??</p>

<p>Reply By: MyNameIsNobody<br />Very strange but if I have both dragon bombs still and i pick up tomahawks, it lets me use the tomahawks but shows the beacon grenade symbol. if i pick it up after throwing both, then it shows tomahawk symbol but i still have the dragon bombs and can throw them after getting max ammo...</p>
