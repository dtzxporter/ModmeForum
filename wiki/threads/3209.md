<p>For some reason my zombies die after around 30 seconds after spawning in, just to respawn again, im not sure how to fix it. Ive never really seen that behaviour on any other map and ive looked to see if ive changed anything. Here are the KVP&#39;s on my spawner, i first thought makeroom was the issue but that did nothing.<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.685.png' | relative_url }}"></p>

<p>Ok so i fixed it, all i did was move the map over the 0,0 point and it suddently worked like normal :)</p>

<p>i think you mean above Z - 0<br /><br />this is a safe guard that kills zombies on the rare occasion they &quot;fall out of the map&quot;</p>
