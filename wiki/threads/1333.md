<p>Thread By: modric<br />Is it possible to have a dynamic ball that rolls when players kick it? similar to fortnite, also i think a black ops 2 map had dynamic basketballs so COD has done it as well.</p>

<p>Reply By: modric<br />Couldn&#39;t find dynamic as an asset type. Is it like an xmodel that i add a phys preset to and then i make it dynamic in attributes or properties</p>
