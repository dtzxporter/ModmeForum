<p>I&#39;m making a construction-type map with references to the song &#39;Square Hammer&#39; by Ghost. I would like a melee weapon of the hammer from that song&#39;s music video (Like this: <a href="https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-the-square-hammer-from-square-hammer-104367">https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-the-square-hammer-from-square-hammer-104367</a> but obviously more detailed). Could maybe use animations from the Hammer of Valhalla or something.</p>
