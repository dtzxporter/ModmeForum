<p>Unsure if this post will get any attention or if I&#39;m asking in the completely wrong place for this, but I was hoping if anyone would be able to rig models from the source engine into BO3 or help teach me how. <br />I&#39;ve at least tried to rig the models but I cant find a tutorial on where to start or how to do it. If anyone could help or lead me in the right direction I&#39;d be hella grateful for it. Thanks</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got a repository of crap that i&#39;m thinking about dumping on here from my old L4D map from a bit ago, so maybe shoot me a PM or something and I can hook you up with anything you may need. pics attached for reference.<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.13.jpg' | relative_url }}"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.14.jpg' | relative_url }}"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.15.jpg' | relative_url }}"></p>
