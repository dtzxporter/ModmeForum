<p>Thread By: The Black Death<br /><p style="text-align:left;">To elaborate more, basically I added a few of Rico&#39;s guns into my map. I added their aliases and no errors occur, but they do not play in game, <strong>full stop</strong>.</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">I decided to experiment on this issue, and I tried editing an alias to add the <strong>exact </strong>path of one sound which is working perfectly in-game for a different gun. <strong>Sound did not play. </strong>I also intentionally tried making an <em>incorrect </em>path, and woila, whilst building I got errors saying couldn&#39;t find sound. Then I tried putting one of the new gun&#39;s sounds into the working gun, and then the gun&#39;s shoot sound stopped playing.</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">So... The game knows the sounds are there, but it&#39;s not doing anything towards converting (I guess) and actually getting them to work, which is stupid. Does anyone know why this has occured? Previously when I&#39;ve added sounds it&#39;s started using them within a couple days, but this time it&#39;s been nearly a week and <strong>nothing</strong>. Why?</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">If you have a fix well... thanks in advance.</p></p>
