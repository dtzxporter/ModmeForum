<p>Thread By: KillJoyYT<br />When I put a brush over the ceiling of my room everything looks fine in radiant so I save and launch the map<br /> <br />as soon as I load in everything is invisible and I can just see the skybox<br /> <br />so I deleted the ceiling and relaunched the map and everything was fine....no invisible walls or models<br /> <br /> <br />but then I put the ceiling back on and even if I change the texture it still makes the whole room invisible<br /> <br />what gives?</p>

<p>have a small space open on the roof or remove it completely and everything will return to normal</p>
