<p>Or just use the Electric Cherry GSC provided in the tools? There&#39;s a guide on the wiki if you don&#39;t know how to fix it yourself. What do you need to change hintstrings for?</p>

<p>I changed the icon and jingle to be a new perk but I was fine with its ability still being the same as EC... just want it to say my custom perks name instead. harry ill send it to you if youd rather change the value for me and then send it back if its annoying to link a decompiler.</p>

<p>id rather just make it another custom perk and use EC specialty as long as that wouldnt bring any issues</p>

<p>that specialty isnt linked to any engine functionality, so no issues, use as you please<br /><br />for anyone curious about what i mean in the tools cherry script<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/8528a10d63a71f721b98882e2363d54f.png"><br /><br />these have been commented out and set to predefined values ( which is always max power ) because these functions have changed in t7, this script was obviously before they changed it over<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/e3c08aa3651e855ef887fd9f2e0b1d62.png"><br /><br />it &quot;should&quot; be like this<br /><br /><br />In regard to this not being the completed script, there is stuff like this<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/687788943ad25f37d2770d69a4810bd0.png"><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/422877e1ffcaa60b6b2bf5552591b164.png"><br /><br />and obviously the price being set to 10</p>
