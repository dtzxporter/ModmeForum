<p>- Imagine a map that has a buyable ending<br />- Play map until you can buy ending<br />- As you buy the ending a final boss appears<br />- Defeat the boss to win the game<br /><br />has this been done before?</p>

<p>There have been fake buyable endings before. But not many maps have &quot;boss fights&quot; at all. <br />If you can make a decent boss fight, then I don&#39;t see why not. But make sure the fight is worth the price first.</p>
