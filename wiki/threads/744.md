<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br /><p style="text-align:left;">I think I may have answered this one before on here. Each entity in the prefab is treated as if you placed it in the map one by one. You would need to reference each piece of the prefab properly with the corresponding targetname inside the prefab itself. A selected prefab can never be referenced in script even when given a targetname</p></p>
