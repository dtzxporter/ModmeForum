<p>Thread By: Frost Iceforge<br />So, I recently created an IW bank system and have gotten requests to make a BO2 style bank. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s even POSSIBLE in BO3 to keep track of how much money is in the bank across multiple games. I know that Project Thor in WaW had a BO2 style fridge that would remember your gun even after leaving the map and loading it up again just like in BO2.<br /> <br />It&#39;s fine if this is impossible with our current assets, but I&#39;d like to know if anyone else knew about this.</p>

<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br />Unfortunately this is not possible because the stat system is saved through the online service which is disabled in customs. I tried this back in alpha but was unsuccessful</p>

They said so in the closed alpha reddit. I tried even still with no luck</p>
