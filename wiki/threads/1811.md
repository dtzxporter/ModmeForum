<p>Reply By: DTZxPorter<br /><p style="text-align:left;">The Ghosts series of engines (AW, MWR, IW) All store loaded images (map ones) differently and can&#39;t be extracted with Wraith, Lime, or the pak extractor.  The only way is to rip them from DirectX using NinjaRipper, Renderdoc, and Intel GPA (Though this will be hard to work with regardless) I am going to mark this as solved since this is the only way to do so, I highly recommend trying a different call of duty that we can get the level textures from.</p></p>
