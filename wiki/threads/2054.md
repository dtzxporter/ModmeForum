<p>Thread By: Fil he Modder<br />i&#39;m guessing that the new update has broke all of my maps that i&#39;ve made prior to the release of the update.<br />i have recompiled and linked my map, when i press launch, it goes to a black screen like usually but ends up crashing with no errors and the launcher doesn&#39;t state anything about any fatal errors. Can anyone help? thanks.</p>
