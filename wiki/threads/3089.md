Compiler doesn&#39;t lie :)<br />In radiant, type it into the texture browser with (in - use) filter on and see if it appears.<br />If it is, double click on it, then press SHIFT A and it will hilight all textures with that texture on applied. You can either press &quot;DEL&quot; from there, or double click on another texture to change it.<br />If all else fails, go into APE and either delete it or rename it.</p>
