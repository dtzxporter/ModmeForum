<p>Reply By: RealCanadianPro<br />Dual wields are the same in someways but also different in other ways. From wraith, and you find a gun you want there will be a _lh or _rh (lh = Left hand and rh= right hand). Then with the rig Im pretty sure you put lh in tag_weapon_left and rh for tag_weapon_right and set the position stuff on the right to 0. I haven&#39;t done dual wield but I think it is the same, maybe Ill try it tonight just to make sure it works. :)</p>

Just to make sure, this tutorial is to port dual wield weapons to BO3, right? Also in the part of the conversion rig, I noticed that you did not mention zeroing out the transforms and using the renameNameSpace script. You only mention the removeNameSpace script. Not sure if thats part of the issue. Thank you :)</p>
