<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br />I have made several boss zombies at this point, but they are very in depth and will take more than a single post to explain. You will need scripting experience to understand it. If you want to simply change a zombie&#39;s model and health on spawn you can do so by using something like:<br /><br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
zom.health = 10000; 
zom SetModel("model name here");
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br />That probably isnt much of help but I know for a fact that there are about 3 people who can do custom boss zombies in the community right now, and nobody is willing to give up their script to do so.</p>
