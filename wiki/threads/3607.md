<p>Hi - I&#39;ve been making good use of Legion to extract audio from Titanfall 2, and was happy to donate to its development. However I noticed some missing sounds - for example s2s_amb_int_pod_v1 which is event #24952 in the Miles bank. Any idea why those might be missing? My current theory is that these events actually just pointers to another asset(s) - if that&#39;s the case, it would be awesome to be able to follow those pointers somehow and get the relevant sounds.<br /><br />Thanks!</p>
