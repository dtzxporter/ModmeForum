<p>Reply By: Mindmirror<br />That&#39;s a good idea... If the script would work. So I&#39;ve installed everything, the perks shuffle, but before the shuffled perk lands,<br />it disappears and this error message pops up.<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://image.prntscr.com/image/c_IjH-9eSEaCfzjVuaqHeQ.png"></p>

That error means the script could not find the perk machine in the map. That particular ending means it couldn&#39;t find mule kick. Are you sure you still have the machines in your map?</p>

<p>Reply By: Gordo1920<br />I&#39;m having a little trouble understanding the directions (sorry I&#39;m new to scripting and not 100% experienced in mapping). How and where do you add the line of script for the target name and script flags. Much appreciated, this looks really good and I can&#39;t wait to try this out. Thanks in advance.<br />                                                                           -Gordo <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://modme.co/emoticons/smile.png"></p>

There there&#39;s a whole section at the top dedicated to adding in your flags and whatnot. Hope this helps!</p>

<p>Reply By: Gordo1920<br />Sorry to bother you again man, but how exactly do you put in the flag and targetname for the perks in the code? If you could send or upload a picture of the script with the flag and targetname you used in your test map, that would be fantastic! Thanks.</p>

<p>If I only put 4 in my map, will it choose 4 random ones, or do all of them have to be in the map?</p>

<p>Any idea of how to get the perk lights to work with this mod? they stay in the old perk location for me, like where they are before they are deposited round the map.</p>
