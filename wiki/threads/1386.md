<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />if you actually expect to get help, you should probably elaborate on exactly what you want.<br /> <br />just saying &quot;area 51 zone&quot; is incredibly vague and could be interpreted in many different ways than what you may be thinking.</p>

<p>Reply By: maxman5050<br />fair enough, i mean a zone with endless spawns, a round that never changes, and sprinters on round 1. I only want these mechanics to be in one zone however. Is that possible?</p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />Assuming you&#39;re doing something like moon:<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
thread infinite_zombies();

function infinite_zombies()
{

	//IPrintLnBold("infinite zms");
    spawner = GetEnt("zombie_spawner","script_noteworthy");

	zm_count = zombie_utility::get_current_zombie_count();

	while(1)
	{	
		while(zm_count
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />Note: this will work if all the players are in area51 (if 1 player is in area51 the zombies will spawn for all players everywhere so make sure they&#39;re all in in 1 area). Also untested.<br /> <br /> <br />.</p>
