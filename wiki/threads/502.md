<p>Thread By: changcow<br />I&#39;m not familiar with mapping or lighting that much so I apologize if this is a stupid question. I&#39;ve searched every corner of the internet and each end of my brain, but I can&#39;t find the solution to why some parts of my map are just... odd. I have a prison-ish area where portions of the walls are <a href="https://gyazo.com/ebc6f03532a1be4f5ebe30a29f7620ac">see through.</a> There&#39;s another part of the map that is an underground basement, when opening the door to it, well, it doesn&#39;t open. And down the stairs in the actual basement you can&#39;t interact with anything, such as picking up parts or hitting the box. Zombie spawners don&#39;t work even though the zone doesn&#39;t kill you. I plan on uploading a video when it&#39;s not late but I hope the description is enough. Even any tips to debugging would be greatly appreciated.<br /> <br />Thanks, ChangCow</p>

<p>Reply By: Wild<br />Can you post a picture of what it looks like in Radiant? From what I can see it just looks like you don&#39;t have a solid texture behind the cage texture. I can&#39;t really see anything else wrong though.</p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />If I&#39;m not mistaking you made a brush that is touching the wall that you can&#39;t see.<br /> <br />To fix this ctrl+shift+click the side of the wall and click on patch/terrain/faces to terrain<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/JcCWQzP.png"></p>
