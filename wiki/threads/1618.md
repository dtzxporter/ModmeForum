I think I was doing what you did from 01:11:00 ;)</p></p>

<p>Reply By: xSanchez78<br /><p style="text-align:left;">I don&#39;t know how many people followed this tutorial or who wanted Infinity Ward akimbo&#39;s, but I&#39;d like some feedback. Did this tutorial go ok for everyone? Any problems/questions? Because I know some of the animations for some of these guns can be pretty wierd.</p></p>

<p>Reply By: xSanchez78<br />Hey, to those who still want to use this tutorial, I found a new occurance of tag_torso being rotated, which can cause translates to not be what they seem, making the offsets you add to counteract the tag_torso&#39;s offsets being incorrect resulting in your arm and gun no longer aligning up. I quickly discovered a new method of doing these animations with constraints. Simply follow the original tutorial but use this method to do your offsets instead:<br /> <br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ar89e831Zoo" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
