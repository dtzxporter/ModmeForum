<p>Here are the individual release weapons from WWII to BO3. The weapon packs, other guns, and credits are at the master hub. Thanks everyone!<br /><br />Unfortunately, 15,000 characters just isn&#39;t enough. So, the WWII Ports will have to go across 2 pages.<br /><br />Link to master hub: <a href="https://forum.modme.co/threads/skyes-weapon-ports-to-bo3-master-hub.2565/">Here</a><br />Link to WWII Ports Page 1: <a href="https://forum.modme.co/threads/skyes-wwii-weapon-ports-page-1.2564/">Here</a><br /><br /><a href="https://mega.nz/#!EPhyiaKA!WqZ9t8kkR-MjMg2DXpV4rgpDWsYMD3aLlAwC5lSQaM8">Weapon common asset here</a><br /><br />

<p>Thanks for these :) I&#39;ve got the MAS to work in my map, but the texture on the scope is missing, so you can&#39;t see through it.</p>

<p><blockquote>Thanks for these :) I&#39;ve got the MAS to work in my map, but the texture on the scope is missing, so you can&#39;t see through it.<br /></blockquote><br />Hey Chroma! That issue is likely because the WWII Weapon Common isn&#39;t installed. The link for it is at the top of both single installer pages. Thanks!</p>

<p><blockquote>Hey Chroma! That issue is likely because the WWII Weapon Common isn&#39;t installed. The link for it is at the top of both single installer pages. Thanks!<br /></blockquote><br />Ah, thank you :) One issue I had installing these was I couldn&#39;t get it to work at all or even appear in the map, until I made a new zm_levelcommon_weapons file in my map&#39;s folder, instead of using the main one. Could you add this to the instructions so other people don&#39;t have the same issue?</p>

<p><blockquote>Absolutely! the levelcommon_weapons should work either way, wether it&#39;s in share/raw, or in your map&#39;s folder.<br /></blockquote><br />Also, is it possible to remove the scope from a weapon that has one?</p>

<p><blockquote>Also, is it possible to remove the scope from a weapon that has one?<br /></blockquote><br />it is for most, yes. you&#39;d have to remove the attachment, change the ads settings, and change some of the hide tags stuff.</p>

<p>All of these are pack a punchable, apart from the Gewehr43 (From what I&#39;ve tried at least)</p>

<p><blockquote>All of these are pack a punchable, apart from the Gewehr43 (From what I&#39;ve tried at least)<br /></blockquote><br />That’s weird. The line for the levelcommon_weapons is in place correctly, right?</p>

<p><blockquote>That’s weird. The line for the levelcommon_weapons is in place correctly, right?<br /></blockquote><br />It was the first gun I imported, individually, then did the pack after, so that may have something to do with it. I&#39;ll try again once I&#39;ve finished resetting my Black Ops 3 folder. Love the new names for some of the guns, but I think the MG42 may get demonetized XD.</p>

<p><blockquote>That’s weird. The line for the levelcommon_weapons is in place correctly, right?<br /></blockquote><br />It&#39;s working now, with a fresh install of the mod tools. However, now I&#39;m not getting any sounds for the guns, and this error after I compile.<br />EDIT: No longer getting the error, but still no sounds.<br /><br />&quot;F:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops III\sound\snd_convert.exe&quot;  pc usermaps\zm_testmap usermaps\zm_testmap zone_source usermaps\zm_testmap english zm_testmap<br /><br />ERROR: f:\program files (x86)\steam\steamapps\common\call of duty black ops iii\share\raw\sound\aliases\user_aliases.csv<br /><br />ERROR: no files for filespec: tst\test_sound.wav</p>

<p>Thanks skye! Really top notch weapon ports! I do have one small request though. Could you add iron sight animations for the MAS 36? It&#39;s the only rifle I haven&#39;t been able to successfully convert to iron sights.</p>
