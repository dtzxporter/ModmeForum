<p>Thread By: Dick_Nixon<br />Hey all! this account is just under an alternate alias for now, but just know that this is Mike Pence from the workshop.<br />I did port the zombies that were, albeit briefly, featured in MoTDR, and since it&#39;s gone, I figure sharing the zombies with the community would be a proper way to keep the memories alive, so here they are.<br /> <br /><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/vaak3b2i4fpdp65/MoDTR+zombies+models+with+materials+done.zip">Download</a> <br />Whenever you use these guys on the workshop, just make sure to credit me as &quot;The Indestructable Mike Pence&quot; as I am known on steam.<br /> <br />I am not really good at writing tutorials for installing my stuff, so i&#39;m going to link a post from ModsRepository to help with implementing them.<br /><a href="http://wiki.modsrepository.com/index.php?title=Call_of_Duty_bo3:_ZM_Models">http://wiki.modsrepository.com/index.php?title=Call_of_Duty_bo3:_ZM_Models</a><br />Everything in APE is done, you just need to do the Radiant side of things, and add &quot;aitype,archetype_zm_alcatraz_zombie&quot; into your zone file, then you&#39;ll be set up!<br /> <br />Cheers!<br /> <br />-Mike</p>

<p>Reply By: iAr7uRo<br /><span style="text-decoration: line-through">someone could pass me the default archetypes GDT of the zombies. I modify the original file and I do not know how to restore it please!</span> <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://aviacreations.com/modme/emoticons/cwy.png"> <br /> <br />I solved the problem, if someone of yours happens to the same just verify the integrity of the files in steam. I also guess that this fixes this error 0xd64697dc. install all the assets that had or get deleted gdts, gsc etc ...<br />I hope to be helpful lol <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://aviacreations.com/modme/emoticons/smile.png"></p>

The zombie model is fine but does not get damaged in the head, it is as if the head were invisible. With any weapons raygun, sniper, rifle etc... I wait for your help.</p>
