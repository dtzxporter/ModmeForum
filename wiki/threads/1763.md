<p>Thread By: mikey<br />Been a long time, but has anyone figured out the export2bin format yet? it seems like its compressed or such. <br /><br /><br /><br />Reason I ask is because it seems like all the programs out there link to the export2bin.exe and not truely create their own xmodel_bin file.</p>
