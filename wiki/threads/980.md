<p>Thread By: Wild<br />Hello. I have triend so many times to fix this problem and I give up so now I am making this topic. Recently I have been trying to use custom round sounds in my map. I have been following the tutorial on the Modme Wiki 100% and I have tried multiple times. No matter what I do the round sounds just don&#39;t play no matter what. I know you need to change the audio setting in Audacity, which I have done, but should my actual speaker audio properties be changed as well? By default the computer audio is at 48000 and 24 bit but even when I switch it to 48000 16 bit it still wont play. All of the audio files themselves are 48000 with 16 bit but do I need to make my actual computer&#39;s audio anything specific?<br /> <br />On a side note this may also be the cause. I have tried installing things such as an update to Harry&#39;s BO2 guns and some of Rico&#39;s new guns. No matter what I do I can&#39;t get those sound&#39;s to work either. So it&#39;s almost of if new aliases that I add just don&#39;t work, which in that case would explain why these round sounds do not play. If anyone knows how to fix the problem whhere new aliases don&#39;t play then please let me know and maybe it will fix the round sounds as well as everything else that doesn&#39;t work.<br /> <br />Thank you so much!</p>

Old stuff still works, but nothing new works no matter what it is.</p>

Because i managed to change the round sound, so it is possible. <br /> <br />Are the aliases in the right place? &lt;--- Stupid question, but just asking it because sometimes the stupid things are easily the ones that give us problems.</p>

If so, then you need to remove or comment the missing sound aliases.</p>
