<p>Thread By: AnUncleanHippy<br />Hello! It is An Unclean Hippy.<br /> <br />I have been working to start porting some weapons from other games into Black Ops 3 (as well as weapons from previous CoD&#39;s) for use on my maps, and hopefully others.<br />This being said, as some of them are not assets from Call of Duty, I will not be making a public download available (but my CoD ports are), because I don&#39;t want to be responsible for the distribution of materials I don&#39;t have the rights to.<br /> <br />If you would like these assets, feel free to message me on discord, showing me the project you would like to have these weapons for. It&#39;s not for some snobby reason, it&#39;s just to make sure they&#39;re on maps that are detailed, and have had care put into how they look. (No box or platform challenge maps) Don&#39;t act entitled and cuss me out if I say no. If you want them that bad, port them yourself, but don&#39;t get mad at me if I won&#39;t give them to you.<br />An Unclean Hippy#2349<br /> <br />CoD Ports:<br /><br /><br />MW2 UMP45<br /><br />

<br /><br /> <br />Thank you for reading and hopefully responding.<br /> <br />One final note and probably the most important note:<br /> <br /><em><strong>IF I HAVE GIVEN YOU THESE, DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, GIVE THEM TO ANYONE ELSE, OR SHARE THE DOWNLOAD WITH ANYONE ELSE, UNLESS I HAVE GIVEN YOU EXPRESS PERMISSION TO.</strong></em><br /> <br />With that out of the way, happy modding.</p>
