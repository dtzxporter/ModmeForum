<p>You&#39;d be better off running a looping script to check how many perks each player has. If the player has &lt; the max number of perks, then give them a free perk. That way, they respawn/get up and get their perks back. Only downside is they&#39;ll still lose their Mule Kick weapon.</p>

But it can indeed be done a better way.</p>
