<p>Thread By: Zixology<br />This is the first time I&#39;ve ever gotten something like this. I cannot compile the map otherwise. Does anyone know what it means or how to fix it?<br /> <br /><a href="https://pasteboard.co/HoWr3Q7.png">https://pasteboard.co/HoWr3Q7.png</a> <br /> <br />I tried to upload it as an image here but it wouldn&#39;t show. The link is the best I&#39;ve got.</p>
