<p>Hi, there !<br /><br />The question I&#39;m about to ask must have been thought for a long time by the more knowledgeable among you.<br />But I haven&#39;t really found an answer.<br /><br />Is it possible to convert the original battlefield animations and rigs, to sea-file? Be it the weapons or the other.<br />So far I had to animate some models myself.<br /><br />But is there a possible solution ? Whether it&#39;s through a custom scriped tool or something like this ?<br /><br />Or is the process too long and difficult to be feasible?<br /><br />I understand that the only one who wanted them, Ege115, had to rig and animate them himself<br /><br />Hoping that you could enlighten me</p>
