<p>Reply By: ZombieKid164<br />Two things:<br /><br /><br /><br />One: I think instead of &quot;4) Open your maps zone file located in usermaps\zm_test\zone_source and add these lines: #using scripts\_NSZ\nsz_kino_teleporter;&quot;<br /><br />you are supposed to use &quot;scriptparsetree,scripts/_NSZ/nsz_kino_teleporter.gsc&quot; It wasn&#39;t working for me until i fixed that<br /><br /><br /><br />Two: How do you make it so you can only use it after power is turned on?</p>

I updated the OP to have the correct DL. Thanks!</p>

Also, thanks for the upgraded script!</p>

<p>Reply By: Blink-420<br />Might be a dumb question..but for the random room spawns, I never spawn there. I looked in the script and there was no enable option for it.</p>

You appear to have either placed it in the wrong folder or did not include it in your zone file</p>
