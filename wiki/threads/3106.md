<p>Hi, is there a chance of splitting the forums into &quot;questions&quot; and &quot;tutorials&quot; ?  <br />I know this will require a bit of work, but it seems like the tutorials are getting lost within the several layers of questions.<br />If this is possible, could we also separate Zombies and MP. <br />Cheers :)</p>
