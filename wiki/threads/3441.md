<p>So after I did this I lost all in game gun sounds for my map? I tried dropping the files from the rar again but this didn&#39;t work.. I also checked user_aliases.csv and my zone file and they seem unchanged, all gun paths are in there, so now I&#39;m questioning why I have no sounds in-game.. does anyone know what it could be?</p>

Things like useraliase.csv and the weapon table as well (not too many things). Just reinstall the guns and make sure every step for them is in your files.</p>

Relink over and over again, and usually that works. But, make sure there are no errors in the linker though!</p>

<p>maybe you had porters sound patch and forgot to reinstall it</p>

<p>I figured it out, aparently you can&#39;t use an old user_aliases.csv. It doesn&#39;t register changes I guess, so after doing literally every weapon manually from the original rar files, it fixed the issue. BTW thanks for the help guys!</p>
