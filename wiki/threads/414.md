<p>Thread By: ZombieKid164<br />So I have a model of a wire that cannot be placed as a model. I placed it as a prop in radiant, and it looked fine, but in game it appears to spin very rapidly. Does anyone know what this is or a fix to this? The model is _props/p7_fxanim_gp_vine_wire_ivy_green_07_smod.prop in radiant.<br />&lt;hr&gt;Another problem I have is that when the player is in a certain area (Island far away from normal map with PaP) Fx lights seem to disappear and reappear at will. Does anyone know what this is or a fix to these issues? Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks! <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://aviacreations.com/modme/emoticons/smile.png"></p>

<p>Reply By: im_shyote<br />its probably because you havent made it a misc_model &amp; added a siege_anim.<br />head over to your Entity Browser and under Misc you&#39;ll find model, choose the model then (make sure its an fxanim).<br />after this look for &quot;siege_anim&quot; under the selected model. push the &quot;...&quot; and select the asset that matches.<br />Done, Compile &amp; hopefully it works. <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://aviacreations.com/modme/emoticons/wassat.png"><br /> <br />[AS FOR THE FX LIGHTS, I HAVE NO CLUE]</p>
