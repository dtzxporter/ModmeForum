<p>Thread By: ItsJasonn<br />Hey there,<br /> <br />I am very interested in the Mod Tools and after 120+ hours of using the Mod Tools I now know the basics of Radiant, and I would like to learn more about scripting since I found out you can do so many amazing things with your map making scripts.<br /> <br />So now I have introduced myself too on here, I need help with something. I know how to stop zombies from spawning and how to kill all of them, but then the round will end. How can I make that the round does NOT end when killing the zombies.</p>

The way it&#39;s been scripted, when all the zombies of a round die, the round ends, no exception. May I ask why you want this? There may still be a solution.</p>

When doing this the zombies should stop spawning till Brutus died.</p>
