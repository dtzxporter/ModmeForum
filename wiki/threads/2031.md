<p>Thread By: D-2-K<br />Ability to purchase and use Galva knuckles when widows wine is equipped like you can with Bowie knife <br /> <br />so basically I never actually noticed this until today im using harry&#39;s perks and Galva scripts i Purchase Galva Knuckles kill zombies etc etc but grabbed widows from a free perk drop and galvas stop working the widows knife kicks in unlike when you have the bowie knife and then purchase widows you still use the bowie knife so does anyone have an idea of how to still be able to use galvas with widows or should i just remove widows perk from map ??<br /> <br />thanks in advance guys<br /> <br /> <br />Ok so after testing Harry&#39;s updated perks that he just released im no longer getting this issue so never mind guys <br /> <br />and a huge thanks to you Harry</p>
