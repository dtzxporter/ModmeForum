<p>Is there a way to select all of one type of texture? (or all patches with one texture?)</p>

<p>apply a texture to a face of a brush, select the face(ctrl + shift + left click), then press shift + a.<br />That will select every face with the same texture. I could never get the ctrl + a to work unless it was on a brush, but it will select curve and terrain patches with the same texture as well.<br /><br />Edit. messed up the shortcut, oops. I should added, you can move the selected patches, but brushes cannot move. you have to deselect and reselect the brush to move it around. Even if all of the faces are the same texture(which they should almost never be).</p>
