<p>Thread By: KillJoyYT<br />is there an easy way to enable the player to ride with the platform whilst the platform is moving? I know ct has a script for moving players with entities but that is far too much for what im looking for... thank you</p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />by &quot;ride&quot; do you mean like lock the player down to it like in a vehicle? if so you can use: <br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
void &lt;player&gt; PlayerLinkTo(&lt;linkto entity=""&gt;,[tag],[view fraction],[right arc],[left arc],[top arc],[bottom arc],[use tag angles],[auto recenter]);&lt;/linkto&gt;&lt;/player&gt;
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />otherwise, players can normally walk on moving platforms alright, so I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>Reply By: KillJoyYT<br />yes lock the player to the platform so the player will move with the platform but can still roam freely on the platform without falling off.<br /> <br />I will check this out thank you</p>

void  ConnectPaths()
CATEGORY: 
CLIENT/SERVER: Server
SUMMARY: Connects the paths that intersect with the entity. If the entity is a script_brushmodel then it must have DYNAMICPATH set to connect paths.
EXAMPLE: vehicle ConnectPaths()

void  DisconnectPaths([detailLevel],[moveAllowed])
[OPTIONAL] [detailLevel] how detailed the cut part matches the entity. 0 or omitted: box, 1: convex hull fitting rough shape, 2: [SUPER EXPENSIVE] use collision shape directly
[OPTIONAL] [moveAllowed] sets whether the silhouette moves with the entity (defaults to true)
CATEGORY: 
CLIENT/SERVER: Server
SUMMARY: Disconnects the paths that intersect with the entity. If the entity is a script_brushmodel then it must have DYNAMICPATH set to disconnect paths.
EXAMPLE: level.ArmoredCar DisconnectPaths()

 <br /> <br />y&#39;all really need to try actually scrolling down the API for a change<br /> <br />not even trying to be offensive but literally ive scrolled up and down the entire API so many times - and just taken note of functions that look like they would be useful, and later searched using winrar through stock scripts for instances of them being used - or just tried them out myself<br /><br />even beyond that just using ctrl + f and typing in keywords and scrolling through the list<br /><br />no-one seems to bother even trying to look through the information you are literally &quot;given&quot; with the tools, its silly really. People always say &quot;some of us are not just - born scripters- harry&quot; - well guess what? nor was I - i used the tools we were given to find it<br /><br />I dunno what you guys think i am, but i have never - in my entire life - been on any kind of course or training to learn this shit, and only got in to cod modding like 4 years ago ( even i had no idea where to start when i first got involved, despite my previous experience in other languages )<br /> <br />open the api in google - look through it - or use ctrl F ( or - better yet - both, reguarly )<br /><br />AND<br /> <br />open winrar<br /><br />navigate to root/share/raw/scripts<br /><br />and use the search - and type in keywords<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/083da508c19bcf2295173625b07496c3.png"><br /> <br />it will return any instance of a script &quot;using&quot; the function, or the script that &quot;defines&quot; the function so you can find out how it works ( assuming its a scripted function and not a engine function - if its a engine function its a) in the API and b) you can see how 3arc used it )<br /> <br />i think sublime even offers some batch file method to search multiple files - im sure your &quot;lord icegrenade&quot; will happily teach you how to use it, throw him another &#163;300 for a gopro he hasnt bought and maybe hell pretend he knows what hes talking about and show you...<br /> <br />But what would i know, ive only been spoon feeding you all for 4 years for nothing <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://modme.co/emoticons/sleeping.png"></p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br /><blockquote><em>Harry Bo21</em><br /> i think sublime even offers some batch file method to search multiple files</blockquote><br /> yeah Sublime has a very nice &quot;find in files&quot; option which I&#39;ve started using more recently<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://imgur.com/LeOvHYl.png"><br /> <br /> <br />Its pretty nice cause it lists every instance something is found, as well as some of the surrounding lines to give you more context of how its being used<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://imgur.com/uZUEKd8.png"><br /> <br />For anyone trying to figure out how to use an engine function, or where in the Treyarch scripts a certain function/variable/notify/etc. is used, I would recommend using this and searching in ROOT\share\raw\scripts for examples.</p>
