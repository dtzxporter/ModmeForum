<p>Basically having trouble changing the perk machine for my map. When I load the game all that&#39;s there is the SpeedCola machine instead of the one I want.<br />I&#39;ve been following this tutorial <iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o-kA9BjZu2Y" frameborder="0"></iframe><br />I am using L3akMod so do I have to do anything special?<br />Thanks</p>

<p>I have been trying this as well, but to no avail... I use Harry&#39;s perks and it has something to do with the gscc.(I think) I don&#39;t know if this will work for your map, but on the map i&#39;m working on I just flipped the machines upside down and put them under the map with just the bottom sticking out lol then put my machines on top. Hope this helps you out...(y)</p>

<p>your perk machine is one way or another not being registered as the perks actual model, you&#39;ve messed up something in the .zone file or the gsc or haven&#39;t added the perk to your actual mod in .csv<br /><br />basically it doesn&#39;t know what the machine is you set so its resorting to the default speed cola machine</p>

<p>Sorry to be a pain, but i&#39;m still a noob when it comes to scripting lol What do you mean mod in .csv</p>

<p>Sounds like I may need to modify the (.csv) file that you mentioned there since I&#39;ve triple checked the .gsc &amp; .zone files and can&#39;t find anything at fault.<br />So what exactly would we need to do with it?</p>

<p>Dedrix are you using a template map?</p>

<p>If it saves you the hassle, I did this before and eventually because there were so many script files in my map folder it would not run the game.<br /><br />It’s definitely doable but it’s always messed up for me so I’m just saying Be careful if you succeed in this cause it may end upmaking your map not run</p>
