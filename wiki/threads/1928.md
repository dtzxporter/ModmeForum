<p>Thread By: Noah Gamerscore<br />So I&#39;m remaking a map from L4D2 and on the first level of the campaign I&#39;m remaking, it has moving search lights far In the distance. Is there a way I can making moving Search lights or like a moving texture or something. IF anyone helps that would be amazing and I would greatly appreciate it.<br /> <br />Example: (Would be like this but moving back and forth)<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sn-HdJxcB3Q/maxresdefault.jpg"></p>
