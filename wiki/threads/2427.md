If you have any problems feel free to contact me on discord: robit#1208</p>

<p><blockquote>I don&#39;t understand how to setup the chalk_e<br /></blockquote><br />To setup chalk_e , follow the regular steps he provided, and then go into blending options and use the outer glow option. Then set the color overlay to black. So the background is black, as well as the inside of the weapon, however the outer glow creates an outline for the weapon. Then you&#39;re done!</p>
