<p>Thread By: Ahmed02354<br />so I have 2 zones and when i enter the second zone i get the samantha laughing eveything is scripted correct... There is no door to unlock it is just a simple open map where I make different zones...<br />The zones are touching each other, other zones do work but those have buyable doors..<br />Is it mandatory to have a door to have a zone work?<br /> <br />- scripting is also fine...</p>

function usermap_test_zone_init()
{
	level flag::init( "always_on" );
	level flag::set( "always_on" );
}	
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />and put<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
zm_zonemgr::add_adjacent_zone("start_zone", "SECOND ZONE NAME", "enter_SECOND ZONE NAME");
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />above &quot;level flag::init(&quot;always_on&quot;);<br /> <br />(everything that&#39;s in caps do you have to change to the name you got.)<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Edit: i assumed your first zone is called &quot;start_zone&quot;, if not, change that too.</p>
