<p><p style="text-align:center;">Since the release of The Last Of Us Part 2, I have been watching various gameplay and walkthroughs.<br />The environments was what struck my eye and tickled my level design inspiration!<br />So I decided to create a scene (not a level), just a simple scene that tells a storyâ€¦ <br />I worked on the below scene over 3 days on and off. Overall it has taken me 4 hours. I decided to record a speedmap/timelapse of me creating it.<br /><br />I will be posting more timelapses of me creating some more scenes and environments aswell as working on projects such as Buried Remastered and Nacht Reimagined etc on my YouTube channel.<br /><br />If you have any good ideas for a scene then please comment below! Would help me a lot :)<br /><br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A2wmINDKgZE" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.772.jpeg' | relative_url }}"><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.773.jpeg' | relative_url }}"><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.774.jpeg' | relative_url }}"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.775.jpeg' | relative_url }}"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.776.jpeg' | relative_url }}"></p></p>

<p>Hey! Looks pretty good to me! One thing that is a bit off is that you need some form of dirt for the grass to be growing out of. I would just make some simple terrain patches with dirt texture or some dirt models (like a bunch of dust accumulated into &quot;dirt&quot; overtime).  Also if you made the clothes have a moldy look with a volume decal or something that would be cool as well. Good work though!</p>
