<p>Add a Volume Weather Grime to your map there are 6 options in  there i think Snow and grass are the defaults choose which texture you want to use and it will replace the red texture with one of these ive got mine all set to i_t7_grass_lawn_medium_small_green they have colour,Gloss,and Normal which is 3 of the fore mentioned 6 settings i removed snow as im not making a snow map</p>
