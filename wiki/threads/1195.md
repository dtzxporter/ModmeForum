<p>Thread By: modric<br />I am trying to have the shootable door triggers around my map only spawn once eetrig1 is triggered, want to know how to get that to work. Also I want to have the models associated with shootable door triggers to appear after eetrig1 is triggered and maybe have the models disappear after they are triggered by shootable door. I also want to make a new ee script that would be a step in my easter egg where 3 fx and triggers spawn after an eetrig is triggered, and to have a character VO when that step is available. Heres what I have so far:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
function EEOrder()
{
eetrig1 = GetEnt( "eetrig1", "targetname" );
eetrig2 = GetEntArray( "shootable_door", "targetname" );
eetrig2 waittill("eetrig1");
  
}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
</p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />Here you go up to the models disappearing after you shoot them.<br /> <br />In radiant make sure that the triggers have the KVP script_string - door_trigs<br />and that each model is a target of a trigger (door 1 will be the target of trigger 1...).<br /> <br />(I never tested this so don&#39;t be pissed please :))<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
function EEOrder()
{
trigs = GetEntArray("door_trigs","script_string");

eetrig1 = GetEnt("eetrig1","targetname");



foreach(trig in trigs)
	{
	model = GetEnt( trig.target, "targetname" );
	model Hide();

	trig TriggerEnable(0);
	}


eetrig1 waittill("trigger", player);



foreach(trig in trigs)
	{
	model = GetEnt( trig.target, "targetname" );
	model Show();
	trig TriggerEnable(1);
	trig thread EEOrder2();
	}
}


function EEOrder2()
{
model = GetEnt( self.target, "targetname" );

self waittill("trigger", player); //self == trigger == trig


//IDK if you want something done here
//maybe: PlayFX("fx name",self.origin);

self Delete();
model Delete();

}
