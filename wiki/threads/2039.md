<p>Thread By: Mr Wafflez<br />Firstly, I know how to add weapons to the box normally. The question isn&#39;t about that.<br />What I&#39;m wanting to do is add a weapon to the box once a player has crafted it. The crafting part it fine, I just need to work out how to add a weapon to the box through script.<br />If anyone knows how to do this, please let me know.<br />Thanks in advance.<br /> <br />Edit: I&#39;ve since solved it by switching to a different weapon table, when needed to in the script.</p>
