Can you go to bo3\model_export\t7_props\p7_clipboard_set\ and tell me if p7_clipboard_01_wpaper_lod0.xmodel_bin is there (or if any of those folders are missing)? If you&#39;re somehow missing the model, I can DM it to you.</p>

I didn&#39;t include them with the download because I thought everyone would just have them... I didn&#39;t add any xmodels, only images, since I only really needed to retexture Treyarch&#39;s models and use brushes. Since two of you somehow are missing it, I&#39;ll post the folder path with the models for you:<br /><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p5eC_5c3JRBGYEUv-iaCdkKszt3RoCKa/view?usp=sharing">Download</a></p>

If you don’t care what your hint looks like, you can stamp the prefab and change the clipboard to just a piece of paper or something like that. If you’re set on it being on the clipboard I can pm with you and try to figure it out</p>

<p>Is there a way to change the actual clipboard model? <br />above notes suggest stamping the model and changing it but that doesn’t do anything<br /><br />Any help is appreciated</p>

<p><blockquote>Is there a way to change the actual clipboard model?<br />above notes suggest stamping the model and changing it but that doesn’t do anything<br /><br />Any help is appreciated<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Just took a peek at the script. The model is set in this function:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
function codenum_set_hint_model(model, codenum)
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br />You will need to include the models you use in your zone file as well.</p>
