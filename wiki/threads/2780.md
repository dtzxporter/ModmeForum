<p>Hi guys,<br /><br />I am trying to make a health bar for an object.<br /><br />I set up a damage trigger on a while loop that continuously checks for any damage taken. Then I had a shader and set the width = to the damage or the amount of times hit up to 250 value.<br /><br />I am not sure if this would be the way to do this? Any ideas? pls help.</p>
