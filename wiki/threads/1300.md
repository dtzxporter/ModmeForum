<p>Thread By: MyNameIsNobody<br />Is there a way to make it like on Der Riese where Dogs start spawning with zombies at the high rounds? I wanted to add dogs starting around level 30, but can&#39;t find anywhere anyone has discussed this. TIA!</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />lol whys everyone suddenly want this<br /> <br />anyway i cleaned up that code a bit ( Devnotes at the bottom ), i don&#39;t see any reason it should cause a crash, unless maybe you haven&#39;t placed dog spawners / spawn points in the map<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
// Add to top of the script

#using scripts\zm\_zm_ai_dogs;

// Add directly after zm_usermap::main();:

level thread dog_non_stop();

// Paste function way down the bottom, not inside any other functions :

function dog_non_stop()
{
	level endon( "intermission" );
	
	n_start_spawning_from_round 			= 30; 		// Round number
	n_minimum_zombie_total_for_spawn 		= 3;		// Minimum zombies remaining either "now" or "left to spawn" - if less the do spawning will pause till the next round
	n_minimum_delay_between_spawns 			= 2;		// Minimum wait in seconds between spawning dogs

// DEV NOTES : 

// Changed values to be easily changed and understandable to nooblets, better if you ever need to debug anyway

// Removed the level variable and the check, no need for it as this function doesn&#39;t support toggling the loop "back off" as you throw straight into a loop which never breaks. Also if your threading this function "at all" obviously they are not going to set the variable to false lol

// Added some isDefined checks to some of the values being passed, odds are these should never really be undefined, but you never know, and these are things that may potentially only error in Developer mode - which may seem irrelevant, but means when you really "do" need Developer mode to track down a problem, this error will block it first

// Advised to thread "after" zm_usermap::main(); - This is safer for things that rely on stock code / functions / variables as it is all set up inside that function

// Added a check to the second conditional loop to break when zombie count falls below the minimum - this will cause the first loop to repeat, up to the waittill on round over before running the second loop again

 <br />This is definitely not how this should be done, people are constantly asking for this lately however so I will take a look through the code and post a proper way in a while<br /><br />Ill post to the wiki probably<br /> <br />EDIT : Ill see what i can do about the power switch lag too, I had already started a while back for Stevie, wrote out code, then got called away by modders and completely forgot about the code I wrote as usual lol.</p>

<p>Reply By: Kabe<br />Thanks for optimizing the code ;)<br />I updated it a little.<br />Now start when the round starts.<br />Now can detect if it is round of dogs and back to start.<br />Added level.dognon_stop to start / stop the spawn of dogs, if we are going to create some EE that requires it or simply use a cinematic while it is being played, simply add &quot; level.dognon_stop = true &quot; or &quot; level.dognon_stop = false &quot; of your code.<br />Now the zombie counter still has also the zombies that are alive and in turn can wake up zombie_ai_limit preventing the spawn of dogs.<br /><br />

 <br />this is not the correct way to do this. You have to structure it differently because you are using &quot;or&quot; and &quot;and&quot; ( || &amp;&amp; )<br /><br /><br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
if ( !isDefined( level.round_number ) || level.round_number &lt; n_start_spawning_from_round || ( level flag::exists( "dog_round" ) &amp;&amp; level flag::get("dog_round" ) ) || !isDefined( level.zombie_total ) )
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />need to force these two checks in to a single condition -&gt;<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
( level flag::exists( "dog_round" ) &amp;&amp; level flag::get("dog_round" ) )
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />otherwise you can potentially get either false positives or false negatives<br /> <br />&lt;hr&gt; <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
n_count_total_zombie = level.zombie_total;
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />this is also a bad idea, your storing the value, not the reference &quot;to&quot; the value. if zombie total was say 10, even if zombies die, n_count_total_zombie will still be 10<br /><br />just use level.zombie_total<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}

isDefined( level.dognon_stop ) &amp;&amp; level.dognon_stop
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />you can simplify this<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
IS_TRUE( level.dognon_stop )
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />if you wanted to check if its instead &quot;false - or - undefined&quot; then :<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
