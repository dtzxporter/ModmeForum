<p>suppose you wanted something to trigger it like in dlc1<br />then just have something like this <br /><br />blahhhhh = getent(&quot;bluuuuuud&quot;,&quot;targetname&quot;);<br />blahhhhh waittill(&quot;trigger&quot;,player);<br />while PlayerIsTouching (cough himself cough);<br />blahhhhh    MoveZ(&quot;25,2&quot;);<br /><br />blahhhhh1 = getent(&quot;bluuuuuud1&quot;,&quot;targetname&quot;);<br />blahhhhh1 waittill(&quot;trigger&quot;,player);<br />while PlayerIsTouching (cough himself cough);<br />blahhhhh1    MoveZ(&quot;25,2&quot;);<br /><br />untested of course but if you read some scripts you&#39;ll know what I mean <br />dunno how to change the screen effects I do know you need to mess with lui<br />or a pgb box or something</p>

<p>The MoveZ would be the script model or script brush it moves on the z-axis which is up or down you&#39;d put a trigger above it and give it the target name bluuuuud cause that&#39;s what I called it you call it whatever doesn&#39;t matter.</p>
