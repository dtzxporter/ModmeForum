<p>Thread By: CraftDAnimations<br /><p style="text-align:left;">So I have recently starting importing weapons from Black Ops 2 into Black ops 3 and that part of it is fine.  But I am now wanting to created an Upgraded version of the gun and for it to have a special camo.  Can anyone point me to a tutorial on how I can achieve this.</p></p>

<p>Reply By: CraftDAnimations<br /><p style="text-align:left;">A custom one.  I followed <iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yK7zmhyFTp4" frameborder="0"></iframe> to the letter and when running game I would always get the ETCHING (I think thats its name) camo</p></p>

Change the pap version to one veiw/world model and have it named _pap at the end or some thing. In this model override the materials with your pap materials, this isnt the most effective im sure. But i found its eiseily customizable.<img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/C8RXKtE.png"></p></p>
