<p>Hey guys so I&#39;ve been working around the clock making my first map and have over 100 hours into it but noticed as I am increasing the map size that I have a invisible line that runs along the edge of my map, pressing i shows that its a sky volume or something, simply says sky on it but for some reason it doesn&#39;t show up as selectable in f9 or any other view. Any help sorting this would be greatly appreciated I really dont want to have to build around invisible lines. (I am in f6 for the first screenshot)<img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1044.png' | relative_url }}"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1045.png' | relative_url }}"></p>

<p>Heads up I wrote it wrong, I was in f9 for the first one, which should show all layers inside the map</p>
