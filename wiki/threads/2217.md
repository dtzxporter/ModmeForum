<p>Thread By: Christians_Gaming<br />Courtyard is the map name not Backyard (I&#39;ve changed the name)<br /> <br />This is my first map ever! I started making this map on March 3rd.<br /> <br />The map will be around the size of Der Riese, and will contain the famous catwalk.<br />Courtyard will also contain a wonder weapon, I will not say which one.<br />It will contain a lot of custom weapons from bo1,bo2 and ww2<br /> <br />Here is some pictures from Courtyard:<br /> <br /> <a href="https://ibb.co/bGZVx7">https://ibb.co/bGZVx7</a><br /><a href="https://ibb.co/dpYCAS">https://ibb.co/dpYCAS</a><br /><a href="https://ibb.co/dATqx7">https://ibb.co/dATqx7</a><br /><a href="https://ibb.co/jHfZqS">https://ibb.co/jHfZqS</a><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Could be nice, if someone could help with an easter egg ;)</p>
