<p>When I&#39;m inside the reflection probe the lighting is normal, however when I go outside a reflection probe the whole lighting becomes super bright. Not really a huge issue but its annoying.</p>

<p>add Adjacent probes that touch the probe in question so you never really go out side a probe just move from one to another <br /><br />VerKO explains it better in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOa08arAXlk">Video</a></p>

<p>Ty, but I still wanna know why the outside of the probe is soo bright. It doesn&#39;t happen on other maps, and it didn&#39;t happen on this one before.</p>

<p>I found the fix. Basically the suns X, Y and Z axis, you know the lines. They were inside a building, and that for some reason caused the light to glitch out. I expanded my sun in 1 direction so the lines would get outside the building and now the lighting works as intended.</p>
