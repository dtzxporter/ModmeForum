<p>are you sure youve put everything in?<br />i tested the same set and works fine for me<br /><br />youve defs included &quot;include,hb21_mystery_boxes&quot; in your ZONE file?<br /><br />Have you commented out these lines in your zm_patch.csv?<br />scriptparsetree,scripts/zm/_zm_magicbox.csc<br />scriptparsetree,scripts/zm/_zm_magicbox.gsc<br /><br />and are you putting in the correct number for the prefabs?<br />remember it needs to be in order (0, 1, 2, 3, etc)</p>

But, are we supposed to put the “include,hb21”  in a more specific space? I put it somewhere towards the top of the zone file, like maybe 8 lines in under something else.</p>

So maybe try moving it to the bottom</p>

<p>Sounds like the gsh is in a script twice</p>

<p><blockquote>Sounds like the gsh is in a script twice<br /></blockquote><br />what can I do to remove the apparent second script? The .gsh file is only in my scripts folder one time. Im a noob at scripting and really have no clue what to look for</p>

<p>the file isnt in there twice, youve got the #insert line to it in a script twice<br /><br /><br />you shouldnt have had to add this line at all so fuck knows what youve done lol</p>

It worked perfectly. Im not sure what happened, as I didnt, and I wouldnt, edit the files/add something. Im a noob at scripting. Thanks for your reply though!</p>
