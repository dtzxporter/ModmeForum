<p>Thread By: Akrime<br />I&#39;m already used to work with Aliases and the .csv files, but how do I replace the sound for the mysterybox? I&#39;m looking for the specific name.</p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />I just looked through the _zm_magicbox.gsc and I believe the sound you&#39;re looking for is called: &quot;music_chest&quot;</p>

Make sure its 48k project rate, and is like 4 seconds (Best time)<br /> <br />Add this in your user_aliases, if you use custom round sounds then add it under there <br /> <br />zmb_music_box,,,FOLDERNAME\SOUNDNAME.wav,,,UIN_MOD,,,,,BUS_FX,,,,,,85,85,50,400,401,,,,,3,oldest,,,1,1,,,,,,3d,wpn_all,,NONLOOPING,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<br /> <br />EDIT: Don&#39;t forget to change the FOLDERNAME and SOUNDNAME lol.<br /> <br />Double Edit: Lol took out the line of if you need help because you said your used to this.</p>
