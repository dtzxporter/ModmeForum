<p>So I&#39;ve moved my old, bugged out map over to a new file and resumed work on it. After reinstalling all of the scripts and whatnot to make it function as it did before the issues that halted work on it came about, I&#39;m now getting a new error that I&#39;ve never had before and can&#39;t find anything for online. Any help is appreciated!<br /><br />UNRECOVERABLE ERROR:<br /><br /><br />^1SCRIPT ERROR: Preprocessor error, No generated data for &#39;scripts/zm/zm_omega6.gsc&#39;<br /><br /><br />:148 : (-10) ERROR:  Carriage return embedded in string literal<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Linker will now terminate.</p>

I got it fixed though so everything is good. I&#39;ll remember to post the script next time I post an error lol.</p>
