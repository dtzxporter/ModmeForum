<p>For some reason the sounds do not play for me. I did everything step by step. Been having trouble with this for 2 days now. Also why can&#39;t I find Wraith or Greyhound?</p>

<p>Well I fixed it lol.<br /><br />Basically I had a game over music I was working on alongside the Giant voice pack and I didn&#39;t put it at 48hz but 41.  Soo naturally the launcher said that file was not correct since its not 48hz. That didn&#39;t really bother me that much cause the Giant voices were my main concern... Well... I fixed the game over music, and now the voices work too. How in the hell are those files even connected? Oh well :P</p>
