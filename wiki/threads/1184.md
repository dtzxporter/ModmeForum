<p>Thread By: simplyzak09<br />Hi, <br />    I&#39;m not so good at scripting and was wondering if anyone could help me write a script for a mini-boss fight.<br /> <br />What I want is <br />&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A player walks on a trigger and an audio will play&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;While the audio is playing the skybox changes &lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;a trigger use spawns on a button in the room that the player walks in &lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;When the player triggers that button a set amount of dogs will spawn on the map &lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;after 2 mins then another trigger spawns on another button,&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;when that second trigger use is triggered another set of dogs spawn,&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;then again after 3 mins, a third and final trigger use spawns on the last button.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;triggering this spawns another set of dogs.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;after 3 mins has passed again new audio plays and objects on the map disappear and then a new door opens for the player &lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ul&gt; <br />So far I have this <br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
thread Boss_Fight();


function Boss_Fight()
{
 {
 trig = GetEnt("Boss_trigger",targetname");
 trig waittill("trigger",player);
 level.playSoundLocation PlaySound("audioFileHere");
 }
 
 function change_skybox()
 {
  trig = GetEnt("Boss_trigger","targetname");
  trig waittill("trigger",player);
  level util::set_lighting_state(2);
  }
  
}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
I don&#39;t know if what I got so far even is right, I&#39;m doing this on a test map first before moving it over to my actual map it&#39;s meant for <br /> <br />any help is welcomed as I&#39;m new to scripting with GSC, And anyone who helps I will give credit to on the steam page when the map I&#39;m working on gets finished.</p>

You can&#39;t put one in another. Paste &quot;function infinite_dogs()&quot; at the bottom of the script and when you need the dogs to spawn replace the for(;;) loop with this   thread infinite_dogs(); and when you need it to end (after the wait(120);) add level notify(&quot;boss_round_complete&quot;)     also read this</blockquote><br /> <br />thank you so much for your help :) <br />The script is working great</p>

<p>is there a way to spawn multiple brutus instead of dogs?</p>

</blockquote><br /><br />suppose I wanted to make it so that on the first round, dogs spawn, then brutus (NSZ version), then Harry&#39;s panzer on the third, what modifications would I have to put on the script to achieve this?</p>

However, is there anyway to spawn a certain amount of brutuses with the press of a button, like how this script allows you to spawn a certain amount of dogs?</p>
