<p>Thread By: mikey<br />I just stumbled upon this tool and it WORKS WONDERFUL! It is kinda like Wrath BUT only for the D3DBSP FILE! Unlike 3d rippers etc, it translate the geo from memory into a obj file, pared with my tool (OBJ TO .MAP) you can recreate any map from ANY COD with 1 to 1 accuracy. The BSP decompiler also spits out a map file with all the static model locations so you can open it in Radiant as a prefab.<br />&lt;h3&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;<br />&lt;h3&gt;Supported Games&lt;/h3&gt;<br /><ul><li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare<br /><br /><li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2<br /><br /><li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3<br /><br /><li>Call of Duty: Ghosts<br /><br /><li>Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare<br /><br /><li>Call of Duty: World at War<br /><br /><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops<br /><br /><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 2<br /><br /><li>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare<br /><br /><li>Call of DUty: World War 2<br /><br /><li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered<br /><br /></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul> <br /><a href="https://github.com/Scobalula/Husky/releases">https://github.com/Scobalula/Husky/releases</a><br /> <br /><a href="https://github.com/Scobalula/Husky">https://github.com/Scobalula/Husky</a><br /> <br />MY TOOL: <a href="https://aviacreations.com/modme/index.php?view=topic&tid=2834">https://aviacreations.com/modme/index.php?view=topic&amp;tid=2834</a></p>

He is ultimately responsible for what goes on here even though the rules say you are.<br /> <br />As for remasters of maps: Yes they can fuck you over for those. <br /> <br />I&#39;m no lawyer or know much about legal stuff.</p>

Porter would never be responsible for the content on this site, especially as long as he complies with any take down notices, this is the reason why websites like YouTube are still alive, there are laws governing this in many countries. It&#39;s also why we require download links to be wrapped in a Download Button, which provides a popup emphasizing we are not responsible for user content.<br /> <br />Tools like Wraith and Husky, they are protected by laws allowing reverse engineering (Both in the US and here in the EU). Companies rarely care for non-commercial use of their IPs as long as it doesn&#39;t damage their IP.</p>
