<p>Thread By: ZombieKid164<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Preview Video: <iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wI5IG1legPc" frameborder="0"></iframe> Hello fellow modders! A lot of people have been asking for an elevator script, and I needed one, so I created one. In this script (which you see in the video) you must turn on the power, then buy the elevator, and it has sliding doors that close while the elevator is moving! Since I am fairly new to scripting, this took about two days to get working right. All the things you will need are in the download. The instructions are also in the download. IMPORTANT: Please DO NOT re-upload this script. If you are going to use this in your map or video, please credit me. (Ex: &quot;ZombieKid164 - Youtube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAm_2-Z_RGUmkLJcN1OfJrQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAm_2-Z_RGUmkLJcN1OfJrQ</a>&quot;)</p><br /><br /><p style="text-align:left;">Downloads: Regular Version: &lt;download data-url=&quot;https://mega.nz/#!B0dFkBCC!x8XTCLhnstdCqiFl22-N2-X4YziYFxm--MDqj1tPPpY&quot;&gt;&lt;/download&gt; If your doors slides forwards or backwards rather than to the side, use this instead (Moves y instead of x): &lt;download data-url=&quot;https://mega.nz/#!B5FxBL7A!-KlgOze59lzJyKXnsXJ--LFom9Y8T1KWt_bo1emH2BQ&quot;&gt;&lt;/download&gt; I hope you enjoy this scipt.  If you find any problems, please comment them and I will try to fix them. Thanks, -ZombieKid164</p></p>

You may have accidentally added something that broke the script... I would try re-downloading the package, carefully changing what you need to in the .gsc, and then pasting the new files over the older ones. If you did not change anything in the .gsc, then try re-installing the package.</p>

<p>Reply By: ZombieKid164<br /><blockquote><em>m1cke</em>Just gonna infrom you zombiekid but both scripts the doors moves backward and fowards!</blockquote><br /><br />Did you actually replace the regular script? It&#39;s not that one tells the door to move forwards or backwards, one tells it to move in the x value, and the alternative tells it to move the y value, so it varies based on which way the elevator is facing. for example, when I first made the script, I told it to move the x, and the door came away from my elevator... so I kept that script as a the alternative and made a different one that moved the y instead of the x, which is shown in the video.</p>

<p>Reply By: xXxmappermanxXx<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Thanks for the script! When I am publishing a map, that uses this elevator script, to the workshop - do people need to also download these files and put them in their directories - or will the elevator work just as it should with out the player having to do anything else other than subscribing to the mod?</p></p>
