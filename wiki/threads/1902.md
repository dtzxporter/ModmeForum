The script_flag is intentionally on the door and not the trigger in this script DONT PUT THE SCRIPT_FLAG ON THE TRIGGERS<br /> <br /> <br />i hope i made this a little clearer as i don&#39;t know how much you know or not <br /> <br />not trying to be obnoxious at all just trying to lend a hand <br /> <br />good luck buddy have fun modding<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /></blockquote></p>

<p>Reply By: Fil he Modder<br />thanks, its just the fact that i put all of the kvps in correctly but it dowsn&#39;t open the door, like i put a script_vector and a script_sting on it to move out of the way but it just does&#39;t do it, that&#39;s my main problem :/</p>

You just need to make sure you actually do 100% of what it says and you can&#39;t say it doesn&#39;t work because I have used his script and it works just fine. His script actually deletes the door instead of moving it so you don&#39;t a script_vector. Just do exactly what his tutorial says and it will work. You said you added all the KVP&#39;s but the door doesn&#39;t move. Make sure if you door is made out of a brush you turn it into a script_brushmodel and if the door is a normal model turn it into a script_model. You 100% need to do that or nothing will happen to the door. Like I said Nate&#39;s script works 100% perfectly so just make sure you do everything exactly how he says. Hope that helps.</p>
