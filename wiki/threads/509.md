<p>Thread By: LegacyNm<br />Just wanna make an area in radiant where the DE characters sound like they&#39;re in a sort of gym type area. Voices will echo around a bit. Anyone know how to do this? Haven&#39;t messed around with the character voices in all of my time in radiant and I have no clue what to do when it comes to that kind of thing. <br /> <br />Any help would be appreciated :)</p>

We should be able to learn what we need from these<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/8ce9409422009808e3044033558092f7.png"></p>
