Are you looking for some custom round sounds to make your map more unique? Then this is the post for you! I have been putting together packs that contain the round sounds from a ton of different zombie maps! Currently as of 10/10/17, I have most of the round sounds from Treyarch&#39;s zombie trilogy. However, Once I am able to purchase more CoD games on steam I will be adding those sounds as well! With that said, just scroll down and select the map that you would like to use the sounds from! I hope you enjoy!</span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;"></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>NOTE (Updated 10/10/17):</strong></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;"></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">- I provide everything that you need so just follow the 3 simple steps in the &quot;Install.txt&quot; included in the download!</span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">- If you use any of these sounds in your map you MUST give credit following the &quot;Credits.txt&quot; included in the download.</span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">- Most, if not all of these sounds are property of treyarch.</span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Extra Info (Updated 10/10/17):</strong></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;"></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">- These sounds go great with my Black Ops 2 Shader Pack! You can find my shader pack here: <a href="http://modme.co/index.php?view=topic&tid=629">http://modme.co/index.php?view=topic&amp;tid=629</a></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">- If you use the Origins round sounds and my shaders then why not use my Origins HUD as well! My Origins HUD can be found here: <a href="http://modme.co/index.php?view=topic&tid=1022">http://modme.co/index.php?view=topic&amp;tid=1022</a></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">- I will try and eventually add as many round sounds from as many maps as I can. Reply to this post telling me what maps you would like to see round sounds from!</span></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">- If you make a tutorial on these sounds you MUST provide a link to this Modme post!

Black Ops 3 has a 2000 aliases limit I believe. You will hit this limit if you have too many assets installed such as Harry&#39;s perks, Harry&#39;s BO2 weapons, Rico&#39;s weapons, Zeroy&#39;s flamethrower, etc. Remove some aliases and these should work. Sadly, these are the only possible solutions that I know of. If none of them work them I am sorry!</span><br /> <br /><em><strong><span style="color:#999999;">Q: &quot;Will you add round sounds from other CoD games?&quot;</span></strong></em><br /><em><strong><span style="color:#999999;">A: </span></strong></em><span style="color:#999999;">Yes, however as of 5/28/17 I only have WaW, BO2, and BO3 on Steam so until I can afford to purchase the other CoDs on Steam I will just be sticking to Treyarch&#39;s sounds.</span><br /> <br /><em><strong><span style="color:#999999;">Q: &quot;What map will you be doing round sounds from next?&quot;</span></strong></em><br /><em><strong><span style="color:#999999;">A: </span></strong></em><span style="color:#999999;">I don&#39;t know exactly which map but it will be a map from Zombie Chronicles. Feel free to let me know which map you&#39;d like sounds from!</span><br /> <br /><em><strong><span style="color:#999999;">Q: &quot;Will you add round sounds that you have created yourself?&quot;</span></strong></em><br /><em><strong><span style="color:#999999;">A: </span></strong></em><span style="color:#999999;">Eventually if I have the time and interest then I will but until then I am sticking with sounds from other zombie maps.</span><br /> <br /><em><strong><span style="color:#999999;">Q: &quot;I&#39;ve made custom round sounds. Can I send them to you to add to this post?&quot;</span></strong></em><br /><em><strong><span style="color:#999999;">A: </span></strong></em><span style="color:#999999;">PM me here on Modme and we can talk. I probably won&#39;t accept every submission, however if I feel the sounds are good enough then I will add them! Full credit will be given to you of course :)</span></p>

<p>Reply By: Frost Iceforge<br />Since you say you&#39;re gonna buy other CoD games for their round sounds, does that just mean Infinite Warfare? Black Ops 1 just used the Nacht round sounds for all maps, and those are on Tranzit and Die Rise as well.</p>

I&#39;ll also do the round sounds (if there are rounds lol) from CoD:WWII aswell.</p>

I don&#39;t own BO1 just yet so I can&#39;t get it from there and I am not sure where the round sounds are located in WaW. However I can take the sounds from BO2 since Tranzit, Die Rise and Nuketown use the same round sounds as BO1 and WaW. Is that fine?</p>

<p>Reply By: Wild<br /><blockquote><em>BlackMamba231</em><br />Dude I can&#39;t get the Gorod Krovi sounds to play when I start the map :/</blockquote><br /> Have you tested any of the other round sounds? If so make sure you remove the aliases from the other sounds you used and replace it with the Gorod aliases. If you haven&#39;t used any other sounds just make sure you aren&#39;t hitting the aliases limit. This will happen if you have too many assets installed such as Rico&#39;s weapons, Harry&#39;s weapons and perks, John&#39;s weapons and so on. Let me know if all of that is all set :)</p>

It&#39;s kinda weird. BO3 has a 2000 aliases limit. Could you let me know what kind of things you have installed please. So like what weapons, perks, etc... Also if you go into your user_alises can you tell me how many lines of text there are in the file. That&#39;s a way we can get a rough estimate of how many aliases you have in that file if that makes sense lol.</p>

Make sure that the sounds got put into the right place. The sound files should be located in your BO3 root directory. In your root go in this folder: &quot;sound_assets&quot;. Inside of your sound assets folder there should be another folder called &quot;AGC&quot;. Inside there there should be another folder called &quot;gorod_round_sounds&quot;. And finally inside that folder should be where all the sound files are located. Is all of that there for you?</p>

I know this is a dumb question but did you compile and link your map before testing the sounds? Can you try removing the aliases from the Gorod sounds and then try one of the other map&#39;s round sounds? Other than that the only thing I can think of is to verify the tools and the game and try again but if none of that works then I have no idea why they aren&#39;t working. I&#39;m sorry :/</p>

Also verify the integrity of your tools and BO3 game and remember to recompile and link your map. Hopefully that should fix some stuff</p>

Are you looking for some custom round sounds to make your map more unique? Then this is the post for you! I have been putting together packs that contain the round sounds from a ton of different zombie maps! Currently as of 10/10/17, I have most of the round sounds from Treyarch&#39;s zombie trilogy. However, Once I am able to purchase more CoD games on steam I will be adding those sounds as well! With that said, just scroll down and select the map that you would like to use the sounds from! I hope you enjoy!</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>NOTE (Updated 10/10/17):</strong></span><br /><br /><span style="color:#999999;">- I provide everything that you need so just follow the 3 simple steps in the &quot;Install.txt&quot; included in the download!<br /><br />- If you use any of these sounds in your map you MUST give credit following the &quot;Credits.txt&quot; included in the download.<br /><br />- Most, if not all of these sounds are property of treyarch.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Extra Info (Updated 10/10/17):</strong></span><br /><br /><span style="color:#999999;">- These sounds go great with my Black Ops 2 Shader Pack! You can find my shader pack here: <a href="http://modme.co/index.php?view=topic&tid=629">http://modme.co/index.php?view=topic&amp;tid=629</a><br /><br />- If you use the Origins round sounds and my shaders then why not use my Origins HUD as well! My Origins HUD can be found here: <a href="http://modme.co/index.php?view=topic&tid=1022">http://modme.co/index.php?view=topic&amp;tid=1022</a><br /><br />- I will try and eventually add as many round sounds from as many maps as I can. Reply to this post telling me what maps you would like to see round sounds from!<br /><br />- If you make a tutorial on these sounds you MUST provide a link to this Modme post! I will flag videos that don&#39;t provide a link to the OP in the description!</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Main Credits (Updated 10/10/17):</strong></span><br /><br /><span style="color:#999999;">- Wild (Setting up the sounds)<br /><br />- DTZxPorter (Providing Wraith.

Black Ops 3 has a 2000 aliases limit I believe. You will hit this limit if you have too many assets installed such as Harry&#39;s perks, Harry&#39;s BO2 weapons, Rico&#39;s weapons, Zeroy&#39;s flamethrower, etc. Remove some aliases and these should work. Sadly, these are the only possible solutions that I know of. If none of them work them I am sorry!</span><br /><br /><em><strong><span style="color:#999999;">Q: &quot;Will you add round sounds from other CoD games?&quot;<br />A: </span></strong></em><span style="color:#999999;">Yes, however as of 5/28/17 I only have WaW, BO2, and BO3 on Steam so until I can afford to purchase the other CoDs on Steam I will just be sticking to Treyarch&#39;s sounds.</span><br /><br /><em><strong><span style="color:#999999;">Q: &quot;What map will you be doing round sounds from next?&quot;<br />A: </span></strong></em><span style="color:#999999;">I don&#39;t know exactly which map but it will be a map from Zombie Chronicles. Feel free to let me know which map you&#39;d like sounds from!</span><br /><br /><em><strong><span style="color:#999999;">Q: &quot;Will you add round sounds that you have created yourself?&quot;<br />A: </span></strong></em><span style="color:#999999;">Eventually if I have the time and interest then I will but until then I am sticking with sounds from other zombie maps.</span><br /><br /><em><strong><span style="color:#999999;">Q: &quot;I&#39;ve made custom round sounds. Can I send them to you to add to this post?&quot;<br />A: </span></strong></em><span style="color:#999999;">PM me here on Modme and we can talk. I probably won&#39;t accept every submission, however if I feel the sounds are good enough then I will add them! Full credit will be given to you of course :)</span><br /></blockquote><br />its so confusing since there is no csv file</p>
