<p>Thread By: ChristiansGaming<br />Yeah I can&#39;t update my user alias sounds. When I change my round sounds, add weapon sounds etc. <br /> <br />I&#39;ve tried to replace my current user alias with a new one.<br /> <br />And I&#39;ve tried to verify my tool.<br /> <br /> <br />Can someone help?</p>
