<p>Thread By: Abnormal202<br />In my map, I have an area I created in which the room is a circle, and I want to allow the player to wallrun around it. How can I do this with a curved surface? You need to put a trigger around the edge of the wall you want to wallrun on, but I can&#39;t draw a brush that is a curve without making it a patch, and then Launcher will give me an error for having a trigger that isn&#39;t a brush. How can you do this? Its gotta be possible, considering the base Free-run levels use it, as well as many multiplayer maps.</p>

<p>Reply By: Exofile<br />First of all, how small is the room? Let&#39;s say you have a square for a second, and wanted the player to run on the inside. Are there any other walls inside that would suddenly be able to be run on, that isn&#39;t supposed to? If no, it should work fine! If yes, You can always use several brushes. They don&#39;t have to be perfect, you can cut them with the Cutting tool to fit your shape, mix and match several of them to get the shape you want just so a curve can be wallrun on.<br /><br /><br /><br />Hope this helps!</p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />Yeah I realized shortly after I posted this, that the triggers don&#39;t have to be exact, as they are not what the player attaches to when he&#39;s running on the wall. I suppose they just need to be touching the wall from the outside, and that&#39;s it? Is it as simple as whatever walls are covered in the trigger have wallrun?</p>
