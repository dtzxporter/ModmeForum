<p>Hey there! Recently been trying to port the CoD2 Grease Gun over to BO through the usage of the CoD2 -&gt; TX conversion rig found on this site, as well as Tom&#39;s xanim tools, but have been running into some trouble. I seem to be doing everything correctly though. I have:<br />. Correctly bound the joints to the model<br />. Dragged on the included viewhands<br />. Dragged the j_gun joint under tag_weapon<br />. Exported the viewhand joints + 1 weapon mesh as an xmodel to use for exporting the xanims<br />. Properly selected the tag_torso and tag_cambone hierarchies when exporting the animation<br /><br />When I drag on a .tanim onto the rig, the animation plays out perfectly. But in game, well, it kinda looks like this: <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/927d233df02f3205af73d3f67b3071b1.png"><br /><br />What am I doing wrong? Has anybody else here used this tool before? I see someone on cfgfactory has had success with porting the CoD2 PPS-42, so it&#39;s definitely do-able, I just have zero idea what&#39;s going wrong in my case. Any help would be most appreciated!</p>
