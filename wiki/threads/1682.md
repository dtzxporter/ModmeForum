<p>Thread By: Zimta<br />Before I start I just want to say that <span style="color:#ff0000;">I AM NOT USING THE MODELS FOR ANY CUSTOM MAP I AM CREATING!</span><br /> <br />Since that&#39;s out the way, I would like to use models from custom maps so I could make thumbnails for my youtube videos (specific to that map). I have been trying tirelessly to do this using other rippers then I came across WRAITH. I have had some troubles with the basic models texture/material loading into 3DS. Sometimes all the textures seem to be there and at other times there&#39;s none at all.<br /> <br />Anyway I wanted to ask first of all what peoples opinions are of me using models from custom maps for thumbnails. I realize its a no-no to use in other maps but since I am using it for a video showcasing the map that will have proper credit in description maybe peoples opinions will be different. Also if people are ok with the idea hopefully, I can get some sort of help with extracting the models to use in 3DS Max.<br /> <br />Thanks for your time.</p>
