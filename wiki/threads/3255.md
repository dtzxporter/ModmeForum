<p>Obviously the title speaks for itself but again players only lose perks in solo but not coop when going down using harrybo21&#39;s perks. Everything else seems to work fine. I know that means i may be missing some file or script but i&#39;m not sure what and I can&#39;t actually find anything on any forums about it except one post from 2016 with no replies, probably because it&#39;s a bit dumb since it means you didn&#39;t do something right but i figure you know, i want to fix it so. Everything else seems to be doing just fine. I am using the localized version and the stock scripts.</p>
