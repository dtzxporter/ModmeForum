<p>Thread By: modric<br />I have tried both 2.2.1 and 2.1 perks, they both display default perk shaders instead of the custom t7 shaders provided. I am calling the perkicon lua from my csc and have other lua in my map that works perfectly so its not a leakmod issue. I have been told that I may need a widget for Harrys perk shaders to work since I have other LUA in my map.</p>
