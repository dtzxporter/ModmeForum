<p>Thread By: HyperionMB<br />So I can have 3 risers in a room and they&#39;ll find the player no problems. But if I add another riser location, the zombies will spawn but no longer target the player. This isn&#39;t limited to zoned spawners, as having 3 in one zone and 1 in the other will still cause the zombies to rise, and stay in place.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Secondary issue: zombies tend to walk around invisible walls when in a big room. Anyone know how to fix that?</p>
