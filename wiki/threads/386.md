<p>Thread By: soul-toktzt<br />Anyone knows what causes this?<br /> <br /><a href="https://gyazo.com/39ab900b60c1b8cba8b02827d5f13fe9">This is the room in game-view</a><br /> <br /><a href="https://gyazo.com/2b56dbe77720c3f4708ae7bb2ade4612">In just the normal view it&#39;s like this, so there aren&#39;t any caulk brushes or invisible brushes</a><br /> <br /><a href="https://gyazo.com/33909691636004cd426929fd3ad5aeb3">When i&#39;m in-game it looks like this</a><br /> <br />The bodies and candles and table and the &#39;flags&quot; on the wall, are used in other rooms too and they are visible.<br /> <br /> <br />Edit: Managed to get these Errors, Not sure what&#39;s causing it tho.<br /><a href="https://gyazo.com/0ea23f6adcef296935ebb0a28a690eeb">https://gyazo.com/0ea23f6adcef296935ebb0a28a690eeb</a><br />(Had to do it with my phone because it went too fast to use Gyazo(gif))<br />It says: <br /><blockquote>ERROR: Brush plane with no normal<br />ERROR: Brush_BuildWindings: degenerate brush<br />ERROR: Brush plane with no normal<br />ERROR: Brush_BuildWindings: degenerate brush<br /></blockquote><br /> EDIT 2: Not sure if this has anything to dow ith it, but somehow i can&#39;t see textures / models in Radiant that are further away than 737 distance.<br /> <br /> <br />EDIT 3: Somehow a door caused this, i&#39;ve been using that door before, but somehow it caused the models and textures in the next room dissapear</p>
