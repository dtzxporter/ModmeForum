<p>Thread By: TrueGamerCalls<br />My question is how to minus what a current level.something? This is what I tried so far, which the teleporter script works correctly, I&#39;m even able to play a sound after the waitill trigger and it will work, but for whatever reason this doesn&#39;t work. I tried debugging and it doesn&#39;t seem to do anything and its not the scripts I&#39;m using it for.<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
// I modifed the teleporter script from unitownpapi (forgot his name) to minus 
// level.hearts by one
function player_teleport()
{
  destination = GetEnt( self.target, "targetname" );
  while(1)
  {
    self waittill( "trigger", player );
    level.hearts --; // This is what I&#39;ve tried
    player SetOrigin( destination.origin );
    player SetPlayerAngles( destination.angles );
  }
}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}

level.hearts = 1;
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />you should check if its even finding that entity<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
e_entity = getEnt( self.target, "targetname" );

iPrintLnBold( "FOUND ENTITY? : " + isDefined( e_entity ) );
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br /> <br />and its &quot;up town papi...&quot;</p>

Don&#39;t know what to do. I put a trigger use somewhere to test it out and I was able to minus the level.hearts that way, but the way I&#39;m trying to do it is not working. I did put my own debugging test and I got it to work, so its just not removing any level.hearts</p>

var--; // yes
var --; // no

var -= 1; // yes

var = var - 1; // yes

I&#39;m able to put a PlaySound or a IPrintLN and it will work, but not level.hearts--; I&#39;m honestly stumped at what to do now, I feel so dumb right now...</p>

<p>Reply By: TrueGamerCalls<br /><blockquote><em>Harry Bo21</em><br />...   reread my answer...</blockquote><br /> I&#39;m sorry, I must be missing something then. By variable do you mean the level.hearts or something = GetEnt(something, &quot;targetname&quot;)? I tried both of these, putting level.hearts in place of the &quot;something&quot; without the quotes. And I fixed the space thing too, sorry if I am wasting your time, but may you please elaborate more?</p>
