<p>Hey,<br /><br />Was wondering if theres anyone here who might be able to help me in achieving a completely custom zombie variant?<br /><br />E.g take an existing model, change the colour of the actual clothing, add text to it, etc<br />Can this be done? If so, is there anyone who would be willing to help me with this?<br /><br />TIA</p>
