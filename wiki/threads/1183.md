<p>Thread By: ReviveMePlz<br />So I&#39;ve done a bit of research as to how it was handled in older games (BO2 just notified &quot;abort_reload&quot; to the client) but as reloading while sprinting is in the game by default I am not sure how I would go about terminating the reload. I have made a little function below already if that helps<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
function reloadCancel()
{
	for(;;)
	{
		if(self IsSprinting() &amp;&amp; self IsReloading())
		{
			//cancel the reload
		}
		wait 0.05;
	}
}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
Any help or ideas are greatly appreciated</p>

<p>Reply By: Symbo<br />what about the opposite?<br /> <br />if(player IsReloading())<br />{<br />player AllowSprint(false);<br />}</p>

<p>Reply By: ReviveMePlz<br /><blockquote><em>Symbo</em><br />what about the opposite?   if(player IsReloading()){player AllowSprint(false);}</blockquote><br /> I thought about doing that but that would be pretty inconvenient and could easily get you killed</p>
