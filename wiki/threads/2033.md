<p>Thread By: Zixology<br />I know it&#39;s possible. I&#39;ve seen plenty of other maps with character voices. I just can&#39;t seem to find a way to change the VO lines in game.</p>

However, I saw that you have to modify the zone file to use zm_vox.csv under gamedata/audio/zm (which didn&#39;t exist and it doesn&#39;t tell you to make that folder or add the file there). Once I did, I was able to get the quotes for taking damage, but no others. Not sure why though.</p>

<p>Reply By: modric<br />I did what mathfag said and like you all I get is damage grunts, no other quotes... using der eisendrache primis quotes</p>

However, reading your post did make me take a bit of a closer look at the file. The instruction doesn&#39;t say to do it, but if you move the OTHER file (zm_vox.csv) with the same name into your specific map folder, then everything will work, not just the injury SE.</p>

Copy the gamedata folder from the download and copy it into your zm_&quot;your map&quot; folder.</blockquote><br /> Maybe I did a little too much, i moved it to usermap/gamedata-and then made these folders to match how they were in share- audio/zm/vox file. i still only have grunts so i must have moved them to the wrong spot in my usermap folder</p>

{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br /><br />moving it to usermap will make no difference<br /> <br />the linker first checks &quot;usermap/path&quot; if not found checks &quot;raw/path&quot; anyway</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />correct - it changed nothing<br /> <br />unless the file he put in his usermap - was in some way different to the one he had in raw</p>

<p>Reply By: modric<br />The .vox file is absolutely packed with sounds- no reason it should be damage grunt sounds only... I&#39;m curious to see what exactly Zexology did to get these to work properly</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />from what i see in the download, he made the sound alias<br /> <br />anyone with no working sounds, prob havent added that to their scz file in their mod<br /> <br />the other file is some kind of &quot;definitions&quot;</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />the gamedata folder is in the wrong place in the download<br /> <br />should be in share/raw not just &quot;share&quot;<br /> <br />this is why people &quot;think&quot; its not working when its in root/share, its just in the wrong place<br /> <br />should be here<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/12f53439282b46a453e7027b4aa2feda.png"><br /> <br /> also if using the &quot;preserved&quot; filepaths from wraith<br /><br /><br />the sounds are in en\vox not zombie\vox<br /> <br />a mass find and replace in the alias should suffice</p>
