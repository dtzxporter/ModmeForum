<p>Thread By: mikey<br />This tool converts all OBJ&#39;s to mesh (terrain triangles) for Call of Duty and can be opened in BO3 Radiant.<br /> <br />Source Code: <br /><a href="https://github.com/AFirstTimeMapMaker/ObjToCODMap">https://github.com/AFirstTimeMapMaker/ObjToCODMap</a><br /> <br />NOTE: This is meant for brute forced ripped levels using a 3d capture program like Ninjaripper to be converted back to .map files, this is NOT MEANT for a house you made in Blender etc.<br /> <br />The program has 2 exes, one labeled SPLIT and a FULL. Split, cuts the map into smaller map files (10 mb), full gives you the full map file (100mb etc). Have to load Split as prefabs in Radiant.<br />*BIG MAPS, LIKE OVERGROWN ETC, CAN TAKE UP TO 40 MINUTES TO CONVERT, 500,000 TRIANGLES, so its working, give it time!)<br />(If you convert a map, and its &quot;flipped&quot;, just flip it on the X Axis and press I to invert the texture)<br /> <br />Here is whats included:<br />OBJ2MESH exe&#39;s<br />MP_CRASH.OBJ (COD4)<br />MP_Crash Map source for BO3 (Will take a few minutes to load into RADIANT!)<br />Readme.<br /> <br /><strong>POSSIBLE SOLUTION TO CRASHING:</strong><br />1.open the exe from the zip file,<br />2.then drag the obj on the exe and press enter, it should work and it will just put the <br />created map files in the zip file.<br /> <br /> <br /><a href="https://github.com/AFirstTimeMapMaker/ObjToCODMap/releases">DOWNLOAD HERE</a><br /> <br />CRASH MAP SOURCE photo:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://mappersunited.com/uploads/monthly_2019_02/rip.thumb.png.36f2c5491049e3ad7a91d71ab7f93e15.png"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://ibb.co/qmwc1pY"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.ibb.co/MPLtN7k/rip.png"></p>

<p>Reply By: mikey<br /><blockquote><em>a231</em><br />Is there any chance you&#39;ll ever make it so we can port those maps on COD4 radiant?</blockquote><br /> <br />You can, the map is written in COD4 format.<br /> <br />You have to open it up in pieces though (using the SPLIT exe) as if you used the full map file (+100 mb etc) the radiant runs out of memory.<br /> <br />Import all the pieces as prefabs though. <br />So import, for example, mp_overgrown0 first, recreate that section of the map, then import mp_overgrown2 (after you align it etc you can delete mp_overgrown0), rinse and repeat.<br /> <br />Two quirks, is that the exe inverts all the textures (just select everything and press I to invert back) and it flips on the X axis, just flip it back on the X axis and its fine.<br /> <br /> <br />So if you want to import Crash to COD4, just drag the obj on the SPLIT exe and it will spit it into many map files, for people who dont have alot of memory and for COD4/W@W radiant.</p>

<p>Reply By: Kompst<br />Doesn&#39;t work. I export a selected mesh from my main .map file as .obj, load it in the exe, hit &quot;enter&quot; and it creates a .omap file with the only contents being<br /> <br />iwmap 4<br />// entity 0<br />{<br />&quot;classname&quot; &quot;worldspawn&quot;<br />}</p>

<p>Reply By: mikey<br /><blockquote><em>Harry Bo21</em><br />i got the same results</blockquote><br /> Again, running the exe from the zip and then putting the obj on the exe, pressing enter fixes the issue.<br /> <br />Open the zip using Winrar so you can add files after the program ends.</p>

<p>Reply By: dreamzyy<br />The method you choose to convert the obj is beyond bad or outright lazy .. No wonder that your exported maps are so large and your tool so prone to crash if you create 1 patch for every single triangle, putting vert 4 ontop of 3.<br />Also, why does your tool crash when you use a obj with materials? Dunno what kind of code you wrote there mate.<br />I hope you atleast divided the vertex positions by 2.54, because husky does not export it&#39;s obj&#39;s in units but rather in cm.</p>

<p>Reply By: mikey<br />Update 1.02 will be released today:<br />*Will allow user to choose to convert a HUSKY OBJ (divides by 2.54) or convert a obj without division.<br /> *Increased triangle limit per file, so less files will be made.<br />Future fixes will include<br />*fix inversion issue<br />*fix flipped map issue<br />*read materials without crashing<br /> <br />1.02 is available now: <br /><a href="https://github.com/AFirstTimeMapMaker/ObjToCODMap/releases">https://github.com/AFirstTimeMapMaker/ObjToCODMap/releases</a></p>

<p>Reply By: mikey<br />Support for GTK Radiant is not as easy as I thought. I am trying to understand how it works, but requires alot of testing.<br /> <br />By my testing, it seems that GTK Radiant does not like terrain triangles...<br /> <br />Patch verts are<br />3,5,7 etc.<br /> <br />Radiant its<br />2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9<br /> <br />Its on my to do list to look into it, but GTXradiant handles verts totally differently than COD Radiant.</p>

<p><blockquote>Is there a plan for v1.03? And could one rip and convert sections into individual prefabs using this - like stairs, buildings, trenches, etc.?<br /></blockquote><br />That would take some sort of &quot;intelligent&quot; program that is capable of identifying the different pieces of the map and then having it export it as such. I have no idea how you would even go about such a thing...<br /><br />I couldn&#39;t get the obj to map converter to work even while trying multiple setting configs, so I just decided to use the .obj map model as a stencil and am drawing brushes and patches over everything since it&#39;s to scale size. It would be easier if the tool here worked, but this isn&#39;t a bad method of doing it either.</p>

<p>Hi there! Recently, Maya made it difficult to acquire the student version of their software. The software is $208 a month, and I am not in college yet. A lot of us are switching to Blender (as far as I know) since Maya has made this decision in May of this year.<br /><br />Anyway, Blender has a built-in option to remove double verts. It&#39;s under a different name now (merge by distance). I did this.<br /><br />Then I deleted all of the materials which I assume deleted the normals as well.<br /><br />My problem is that whenever I open the converter, select 1 or 2, than drag the obj file I exported and hit enter, the converter says it&#39;s converting the file, then promptly closes. No files are created. <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.835.png' | relative_url }}"></p>

<p>I actually signed in, got my old Maya key, and was able to install and use Maya again. I don&#39;t think I need Blender for the time being. I recommend signing in and just doing it that way.</p>
