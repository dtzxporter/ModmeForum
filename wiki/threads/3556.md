<p>Hello, i just re-installed mod tools again after a long time. I keep getting this error, i remember it happened once before but don&#39;t know how i fixed it.<br />I changed the decimal from , to . before downloading mod tools. Radiant says initializing window... and the it freezes with no cpu activity. Any help is very much appreciated!<br /><br />The error:<br /><br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops III\/gdtdb/gdtdb.exe /update

<p><blockquote>prob have to delete/regen gdtdb<br /><br />D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops III\gdtdb\gdt.db<br /></blockquote><br />Thank you, i just have gdtdb which is a batch file, no gdt.db, i&#39;ve deleted the batch but it won&#39;t regenerate after starting up mod tools + radiant. The error did disappear but Radiant still crashes.<br />Also verified it in steam which didn&#39;t do anything.<br />Tried clearing cache too, but no luck.<br />Didn&#39;t see the database file deleted it and it worked thank you Spiki you legend.</p>
