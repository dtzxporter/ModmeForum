<p>Thread By: ItalianMilkMan<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Light from the sun bleeds through my roof. It used to be pretty bad put now its a smaller line. I have tried putting reflection probes around the map and I have two lighting states. Whenever I try to put a shadow caulk in, it dosnt work unless I make the shadow caulk thick enough, issue is, is that when it is thick enough, it goes onto the roof, and the roof is a playable area and messes up all of the shadows on the roof. If I make the shadow caulk thicker so that it goes towards the floor instead of towards the roof, it dosnt fix the sun bleeding through.<p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;"></p>If there is a shadow on my roof, the spot where the shadow is being casted on the roof, if that same spot is where a wall is (on the floor below), then the shadow will be on the wall on the floor below and in that particular spot, it will seem as if there is no light bleeding through (but obviously there is still a lot of sun bleeding). Please help I really need to fix this.</p></p>
