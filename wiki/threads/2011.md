<p>Thread By: Megadeth9811<br />I&#39;ve seen character mods on the workshop, and I was wondering if someone can tell me the method behind converting viewhands from older CODs to BO3 (specifically BO2 to BO3). <br /><br />I know how to setup character tables and such, but I&#39;m stuck on figuring out how to get custom viewhands working.<br /><br />Any help would be appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks.</p>

<p>Reply By: DTZxPorter<br />The reason why you aren&#39;t getting any responses or &#39;tutorials&#39; is because it&#39;s generic in the sense that you *need* to be fluent in weight painting in Blender or Maya. Because you need to reweight the mesh from the old game to the newer joints on the Black Ops 3 rig. If you want to do this, just look for information on armature rigging w/ your choice of modeling software...</p>
