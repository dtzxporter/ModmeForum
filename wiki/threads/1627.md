What level...<br /> <br />Second the following may help:<br />&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;All MP models are black and white, those are the base textures&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Their skins are applied dynamically, and must be found in the XPAKs via loadfile (even the default skin)&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;BO3 uses new texture formats (for DDS export) and requires updated plugins (first FAQ)&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;See FAQ: <a href="http://phabricator.aviacreations.com/w/apps/wraith/knowledgebase/">http://phabricator.aviacreations.com/w/apps/wraith/knowledgebase/</a>&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>Reply By: LowQualityVodka<br />In detail is the gondola console from Der Eisendrache and the corruption engine from Revelation.<br />From what you wrote I could recover the texture from the XPAK file and re-texture the models in APE editor right?</p>

(See the t7_metal_painted image) We don&#39;t have a tutorial for this as it&#39;s very complex and expect you understand the workflow on your own.</p>
