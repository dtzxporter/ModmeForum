<p>Thread By: ZombieKid164<br />Preview Video:<br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K0n5YkalPfw" frameborder="0"></iframe><br />Hello again! (I know its been a while)<br />I&#39;ve recreated my elevator script, which now has the main feature people were asking for: Calling. That&#39;s right, now you can call the elevator just like the one Five.<br />&lt;hr&gt;<br />In case you never saw the first post, here are the features:<br />-Sliding Doors <br />-Elevator<br />-Call Feature<br />-Editable numbers (You can adjust the elevator to your liking)<br />&lt;hr&gt;All the things you will need are in the download:<br /><br />
<a href="https://mega.nz/#!Y5UByQha!VesPZc2OB3N1y7VYQQlM6nkqeOqgE8WBax1H9xEpkNE">Download</a>
<br /><br />IMPORTANT: Please DO NOT re-upload this script. If you are going to use this in your map or video, please credit me. (Ex: &quot;ZombieKid164 - Youtube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAm_2-Z_RGUmkLJcN1OfJrQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAm_2-Z_RGUmkLJcN1OfJrQ&quot;)</a><br />&lt;hr&gt;Also, if you want to turn off the debug text, set zk_debug to false in the script (Forgot to add that to instructions).<br />I hope you enjoy this script!<br /> <br />Thanks, and happy modding! -ZombieKid164</p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />I looked at the script and noticed you did not use an array for the elevator. I would <strong>very much</strong> recommend you change it to an array so that way players can make their elevators out of more than just one brush. Realistically, you can&#39;t make a good-looking elevator with just one brush, because it should have walls around it, and a ceiling and probably some models or trim on the inside for decoration. Shouldn&#39;t be a hard fix if you know how to use arrays.<br /> <br />Also, this isn&#39;t necessary, but have you considered allowing for multiple elevators in one map? you define everything as a level var so that&#39;s kinda impossible right now.</p>

Thanks!</p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />Yeah, I was thinking of releasing an elevator script to the public myself, but then I saw this and I didn&#39;t want to steal your thunder.</p>

<p>Reply By: ltschase<br />Would it be possible to make the elevator doors move down to open and then back up to close instead of side to side?....because when you put an elevator at an angle, the door opens out and to the side really awkwardly, which makes the change door direction option pointless as well.</p>

For example, if it opens by moving left 40 and up 50, it closes by moving right 40 and down 50.</p>

<p>Reply By: AnUncleanHippy<br />Is it possible you could create a version that works without power, and with multiple doors (The slide outwards horizontally from the centre)? I&#39;m planning on making an interior elevator, and I&#39;m not good at scripting in the slightest, so I don&#39;t want to potentially break the script. <br /><br /><br />Also, for the floor, couldnt you just name all of the bits of your elevator to elevator so they all get called to do the same thing?</p>

When I get back to my computer, on Wednesday, I will work on creating a public release of the newer version, which has sounds and multiple elevator parts and actually looks like a real elevator. Thanks, and keep a look out for that.</p>

I removed the wait_for_power function and am wondering how I would modify it so it reacts to a zombie_door trigger.</blockquote><br /> No, I mean I literally have a WAY better version with sounds and an actual elevator and parts (model) that is DONE and you don&#39;t need to do that, just wait please, I am away rn.
