<p>Is there a simple way to stop drops from dropping in a specific zone, but only for a short time?<br />I didn&#39;t see any kind of disable zone function in the zm_zonemgr.<br />I tried:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
zone = level.zones[ "start_zone" ];
    zone.is_enabled = false;
    zone.is_active = false;    
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
which did disable the zone for players(not something I needed, but not an issue for what I&#39;m going for either), but drops could still drop there regardless.<br />I saw killjoy mention a kvp that can make drops not spawn in a zone, but they didn&#39;t know it off hand, the op of the thread said the recommended one didn&#39;t work.<br />Plus I don&#39;t need them to permanently not spawn in a zone, just for a limited time.<br /><br />I also tried just moving the zone out of the way with MoveZ, but that didn&#39;t move the zone. I also tried linking the zone to a struct and then moving the stuct, that also didn&#39;t work.<br />I made sure to enablelinkto before linking the zone to the struct.<br /><br />Any thoughts on what I could do? Would I be better off just doing something similar to the parsites and have them pulled into an area I do want them to drop?<br />I guess now that I think about it, that would be super easy. I could&#39;ve already had it done in the time I&#39;ve wasted messing with disabling drops.. But I kind of would prefer to know how to disbale drops in a zone if possible.<br />Thanks for your time regardless!</p>

<p>This can be the worst method to do it, but is a option.<br />Delete the powerup if is touching the zone.<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
level.nopowerupsnow = false; // Use this line when you want to "turn off" delete powerups
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
level.nopowerupsnow = true; // Use this line when you want to "turn on" delete powerups
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
level thread no_powerups_for_x_time_x_zone(); 
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
function no_powerups_for_x_time_x_zone()
{
    level endon( "end_game" );

    for( ;; )
    {
        level waittill( "powerup_dropped", powerup );

        powerup thread xcheck_this_powerupx();
    }
}

function xcheck_this_powerupx()
{
    self endon( "powerup_grabbed" );

    self endon( "powerup_timedout" );

    zone = level.zones[ "YOUR_ZONE_NAME" ]; // Put your zone name

    while( 1 )
    {
        if( !isdefined( self ) )
        {    
            break;    
        }

        if( isdefined( self ) &amp;&amp; self IsTouching( zone ) &amp;&amp; IS_TRUE( level.nopowerupsnow ) )
        {
            self Delete();    

            break;    
        }

        WAIT_SERVER_FRAME;
    }
}

{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
NOTE: If the powerup spawn in your face killing a zombie, probably you can grab it. xD</p>

<p><blockquote>This can be the worst method to do it, but is a option.<br />Delete the powerup if is touching the zone.<br /></blockquote><br />That&#39;s a good idea actually. I added a check to the powerups.gsc that if my gamemode is active, and the drop is in the zone I don&#39;t want drops in, it drags it into the new playable area.<br />I get so fixated on doing something a certain way I go blind haha. I&#39;m gonna look in the powerups.gsc again. I&#39;m 99% sure I can add a check before it spawns and just not let it spawn to begin with instead of deleting it after it spawns, that way people won&#39;t see it get deleted. If I can&#39;t add check to not let them spawn, I can just delete it like you suggested.<br />Thanks so much for helping out!<br /><br />Edit. So you can indeed just add your own check and then the drop just wont spawn! It works just how I wanted. The sad part is I just needed to move my original check up literally 10 lines from where it was, and change what runs to:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
level.powerup_drop_count--;
        powerup delete();
        return;
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 instead of running my drop_move function haha.</p>

<p>Create a volume and give it the kvp for no drops<br /><br />Put it over your zone<br /><br />Either hide / unhide or move it miles under when needed<br /><br /><br />Look in _zm you’ll find the kvp</p>

The only thing that even mentioned drops was the init of the powerups script. <br />I appreciate the input, I&#39;ll probably spend some time looking through other zm related scripts to see if I can find it at another time</p>

Thanks for taking the time to look for it!<br /></blockquote><br />“Targetname” “no_powerups” judging by what he posted<br /><br />Literally just move the volume as and when you need<br /><br />Might even work with hide()/show()<br /><br />And yea that is the function that checks for it yea<br /><br />Thx for that, not at a computer to check<br /><br />You can also put these over your windows and shit to stop power ups out of bounds<br /><br />Make sure to give it another kvp so you can grab it, like a script_noteworthy</p>
