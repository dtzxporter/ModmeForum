<p>...and what is the proper way of adding them in ape onto a model? What &quot;map&quot; type are they? Or are they something different? Noob questions I am sure, but some help would be appreciated! All of the model importing tutorials I have watched never mention these!<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.391.png' | relative_url }}"></p>

There&#39;s usually an almost identical texture that it belongs with (but a bit duller)</p>
