<p>Thread By: Dextro62<br />If I die while I have Who&#39;s who sometimes it spawns me in unplayable areas like behind the barriers that zombies have to break down. How do i specify which areas Who&#39;s who should not spawn the player in.<br /> <br />Sorry wasn&#39;t sure if this should be in scripting or radiant section.</p>
