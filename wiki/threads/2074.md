i used both genesis an the factory default zombies
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />In response to this<br /> <br />a - the napalm uses his own spawner, these have nothing to do with him<br />b - you should ONLY be using the genesis ( usermap ) spawners, the factory ones are missing animations</p>
