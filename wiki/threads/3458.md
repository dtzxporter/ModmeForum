<p>Powerup: Shield Power; Gives you a shield like deathmachine that instakills in Melee and gives the 120 points as knife over this 30 sec. Invulnerable against hits at the front.<br />Perk: Hangover Relief Elixir; Effect; Makes the Shield like Thundergun when they hit you from behind, and taking it as your weapon will create the thundergun wave at the front by hitting with it. But ofc a cooldown like the Winters Wail that stucking when no hits on the shield has been created for like over 10 sec.</p>

<p>Awesome! Looks good man! Have you tested it out with an buildable shield on your back? When I tested out making the Deathmachine gives you the shield, it broke the one you had on your back, but it was an awesome deathmachine I used for a long time xD But if this powerup you working at works, and not destroying any of the buildable shields, this will get 10/10 !</p>

Seems to work fine and not mess with any other shields</p>

<p>I guess that&#39;s the plan but its Hella broken and crashes the game after taking damage lol. Its a WIP for now but don&#39;t set your heart on a release because I get distracted with other projects pretty easily.</p>
