<p>Thread By: BlackMamba231<br />I got this error right after I installed Wardogs perks but I don&#39;t even have a _zm_weapons file on my scripts folder. Btw I don&#39;t really know if this has to do with wardogs perks.<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/x03HFeO.jpg"></p>
