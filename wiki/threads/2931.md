<p>Hello all,<br /><br />Im going to need somebody&#39;s CodMayaTools download plugin for Maya, if you have it installed. I cant seem to install it into Maya, as the files that are listed in the tutorial for the download are not in the download file (yes im trying the most recent version of the CodMayaTools). I have also tried older downloads but the specific files in the tutorial for the download are never in the download itself. <br /><br />If someone were to be so kind to send me their contents in the USER\Documents\maya\(your maya version)\scripts    folder, I would greatly appreciate it. Reply to this or PM me your discord if you want to send the contents. You will be credited when my map is released.<br /><br />Regards,<br />the_bibba_boy</p>
