<p>Thread By: Abnormal202<br />So I was converting a map I made for WaW into a black Ops 3 map, and I brought over all the textures and changed the models and such. However, one thing I cannot figure out is why the lights are reflecting on every surface as shown in the picture below.<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/1oMomvO.png"><br /><br />every light does this to every surface nearby and it looks as if everything is made of shiny plastic.<br /><br />Is there a way to turn this off? even when starting the lighting over, all the lights I create do this.</p>

<p>Reply By: Exofile<br />Could be that the materials are made to be that refective? If not, I recommend to look into your reflection probes, and to be sure they cover everything they need to properly.</p>

<p>Reply By: Beatthat<br />Select one of your lights, then press Shift+A ( this will select all your light entities ) Hop over to your Entity Info window and turn down the value of spec_comp. Should be a negative value, I&#39;d suggest something like -10, but you can play around with that. Hope that helps.</p>
