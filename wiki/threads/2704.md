<p>I downloaded Skye&#39;s BO4 Weapon Ports and put them into my map. These weapons are accessible via console commands but when I try to buy them off the wall, I can&#39;t.<br /><br />Before level restart:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.124.png' | relative_url }}"><br /><br />After level restart:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.126.png' | relative_url }}"><br /><br />Any idea what could possibly be wrong in my map&#39;s zone files and/or .gsc .csv scripts?</p>

<p>idk, mine only showed as 0 when i had too many conflicting gun packs... you can check the weapons csv (levelcommon in shared or wherever you keep these) and make sure the first number value isnt 0</p>

<p>I have managed to fix this issue! <br /><br />What i did was I took the levelcommon price, and kept it the way it was.<br />i then added the zombie_cost KVP and made it the same as the levelcommon. This seemed to work. I was able to see the correct price, and purchase it for that price, too.<br /><br />I also removed any spaces i had in the levelcommon file, but im not sure if that has anything to do with it or not. I hope this works for you and anyone else having this issue!!!</p>

<p>Does your fix apply to the ammo price of normal and pack a punched versions? ive noticed custom guns such as skye ww2 guns will show the wrong price for the pap ammo wallbuy (supposed to be 4500 for all guns)</p>
