<p>so this was made 1:1 with no tools at all? didn&#39;t use any tools to get textures? or even mats? damn, really impressive</p>

<p>Then how would you confirm they are 1:1 lol<br /><br />I would hazard a guess this was done with scobs hydraX</p>

<p>The assets were originally ported with Greyhound and the materials were set up in ape manually by me, could&#39;ve released them that way but I waited for Scobalula to update HydraX so I could get them 1:1 to Treyarchs. Forgot to credit people, which was my mistake.</p>
