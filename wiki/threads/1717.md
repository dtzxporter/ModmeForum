<p>Thread By: Optomusprime22<br />I have followed the instruction on the perk wiki page very carefully but when I do I get an error...   It says I&#39;m missing xmodel ec on and xmodel ec off.... it also says it has a problem with __init__() if I could get help on this matter that would be great<br /><br />thanks Optomusprime22</p>

<p>Reply By: DTZxPorter<br />Clearly you didn&#39;t read it properly if you didn&#39;t see you have to port the model yourself.</p>

<p>Reply By: Optomusprime22<br />Why would the model be on there then?</p>

<p>Reply By: Koan<br /><blockquote><em>Optomusprime22</em>Why would the model be on there then?</blockquote><br /><br />The model isn&#39;t included in the prefab (that would be giving away raw assets), it&#39;s just a template for you once you&#39;ve ported the model.</p>

<p>Reply By: Optomusprime22<br />So there is no way to do this if I don&#39;t have access to bo2 on this computer...</p>

<p>Reply By: AvidPenguin<br />As I don&#39;t have any BO2 DLC on PC, I can&#39;t port the model over, however, is it possible to give the player a perk (or a random one) via scripting and a trigger? I assume it&#39;s simple, I&#39;m just having an issue with linking a script and a trigger</p>

I&#39;ll give it another shot some other time, focusing on trying to get gobblegums and wunderfizz to work for now...</p>

Then, you don&#39;t need BO2/BO2 DLC.</p>
