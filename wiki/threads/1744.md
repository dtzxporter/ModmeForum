<p>Thread By: wormhero1<br />Does anyone know how to make a wallbuy for a custom weapon? I&#39;ve tried copying the weapon prefabs that already exist, but it doesn&#39;t work. In-game, the prompt to buy the gun will come up, but it says it costs 0 points, and it won&#39;t let me buy it.</p>

<p>Reply By: SevenGPLuke<br />Your prefab may bw working but I&#39;m pretty sure something needs to be scripted as well. In WaW you had to add the weapon file name to dlc3_code and zombiemode_weapons to get it fully working. A similar process may be needed for bo3 so try checking your maps scripts and try to findone of the weapon names thats already buyable off wall/in box. I don&#39;t know the process yet as I&#39;m currently not working on a zm map. Ta-ta</p>

<p>Reply By: xSanchez78<br />In WaW, include_weapon&#39;s were called in the mapname file which sniperbolt or whoever it was moved all that crap into a user friendly dlc3_code script, and add_zombie_weapon&#39;s are called from _zombiemode_weapons. Now, those are all called based off of a stringtable that is loaded at the start of the game. To add your custom weapon, all you have to do is go to BO3 Root/share/raw/gamedata/weapons/zm/zm_levelcommon_weapons.csv, open it, and copy a similar weapon&#39;s line and paste it at the bottom, and rename the weapon&#39;s name ( the first entry ) to your weapon&#39;s name, and rename the weapon&#39;s upgraded name ( the second entry ) to the weapon&#39;s upgraded file ( if you don&#39;t have one yet, leave it blank ). Then you can change the cost and whether it&#39;s in the box or limited etc. If you need help just PM me exactly what your weapon needs and I can quickly make a line for you.</p>
