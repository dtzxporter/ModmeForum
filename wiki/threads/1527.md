<p>Reply By: itznvy<br />Okay well everything looks to be ok. Make sure it&#39;s in your zone file i guess, that&#39;s all i can tell you or make sure its set to be map specific</p>

<p>Reply By: ProRevenge<br />Make sure the weaponfile names have _zm in the GDT and Zone file, this isn&#39;t needed in zm_levelcommon_weapons.csv however<br />Other than that make sure the weaponfiles have gun models set, all anims set etc, It can only be something in the weaponfile or in how you are adding the weapons to the map, which looks to be in order</p>
