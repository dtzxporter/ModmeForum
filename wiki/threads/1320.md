<p>Thread By: maxman5050<br />im currently working on a map that is pretty large and detailed. My maps .gsc has 459 lines of code. When i run my map I dont get any errors and it lets me run it, but it sits at the black screen forever. Is this a radiant problem or a scripting problem? Also is there a way to fix this without deleting things from the map?</p>
