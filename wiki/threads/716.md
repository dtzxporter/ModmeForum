<p>Thread By: dkamasta<br />This is a question for a MOD, not a map.<br /><br /><br /><br />Box with custom weapons and sounds got that working check (for every map)<br /><br />temp box fix have custom box with pap guns in it working check (for every map)<br /><br />start with a custom pap gun got that working check<br /><br />but when I try do this just in levelcommon_weapons.csv all guns show up also custom but not the PAP ones<br /><br />And in that file its the one after: show in box TRUE,FALSE I make it TRUE,TRUE so also show pap in box but wont show.<br /><br />I tried add level.chest_level = 1;  but still dont show, only show none pap<br /><br /><br /><br />help help<br /><br /><br /><br />also I want to get it to work that the custom weapons of a map work together with my custom guns, is this possible?<br /><br />I mean lately many maps have ported guns in box. I see them, but I cant get them, cause I use my own levelcommon_weapons.<br /><br />But I would like to set it up, that both guns are usable. so map and mod guns<br /><br />Also I cant buy custom guns from wall when I use my levelcommon_weapons in my mod. Do I just need change the name of my csv file or? so that they add up or?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/178288429004424649/E13C051D3300D205BF3D5D3FEBD65416F881BD36/?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;output-format=jpeg&amp;output-quality=95&amp;fit=inside|637:358&amp;composite-to%3D%2A%2C%2A%7C637%3A358&amp;background-color=black"></p>

<p>Reply By: tbone-5<br />i could not figure out why guns wont come out of the box papped either seems like that line is broken, you can force a pap gun in the box by making the pap gun in the normal weapon slot if you really wanted to, im making a weapon mod to how did you change the starting pistol? i would like to know i don&#39;t know much about doing this stuff in mods got everything working but a custom starting weapon so far, in maps its easy. also you cant buy custom wall weapons because the weapons have to be in your levelcommon so just like how you would get a PPSH wallbuy working in a custom map with one you add it to your levelcommon, but the only thing is you need to find there spawn IDs using console or something make them not show up in the box.</p>

<p>Reply By: dkamasta<br />getting a startgun has been shared many times, but I will show you<br /><br /><br /><br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
startingWeapon = "mwr_mp5_upgraded";
 weapon = getWeapon(startingWeapon);
 level.start_weapon = (weapon);
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br /><br /><br />for full box control I used a video from MAKECENTS:<br /><br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qQmcPAwShGQ" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br />so that all works fine, but I think couldnt we script it that it adds up the guns with the custom guns of the map??<br /><br />but with this temp. box fix you can put pap and normal guns in box. So I think that is the only solution now. cause with levelcommon_weapons it wont show pap guns.</p>
