You can learn a lot about functions and stuff by going to root\docmodtools (or something like that, I&#39;m not at my pc rn) and open the files named gsc and bo3 scriptAPIfunctions (again, the names are hopefully close) and those should help you a lot as you go. Hope I helped! <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://aviacreations.com/modme/emoticons/smile.png"></p>
