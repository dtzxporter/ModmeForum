<p>Reply By: DTZxPorter<br /><strong>Notice to all: Please make sure your version (at the top of a running Wraith window) is &gt;= 1.11</strong>, if not please download the latest linked in the first post. It contains my automatic updater so you&#39;ll always be able to use Wraith and get the latest changes. Some noticeable improvements are completely fixed animations with NO jitter at all, a fix for AI animations falling through the floor and some stability tweaks.</p>

<p>Reply By: SpiderManMan<br />Hey Porter, I&#39;m loving the tool so far great work. One problem I&#39;m having is when I try to use the feature &quot;Patch model and anim tags to support older games&quot; it breaks the animations (some finger joints way out of place). Also the bind script while using the older tags don&#39;t bind everything in maya.</p>

There is a member working on a maya scene which will actually convert my animations into a working older rig. Hopefully it will be finished soon! Sorry for the inconvenience, the rigs have changed a lot since the older games.</p>

Simply build your model as mpbody in assman/APE and it will add all the stablizer bones for you, which will fix this issue.</p>

Second, if you have the latest version of wraith there is not progress bar (besides bulk export), third, &quot;Waiting...&quot; is present tense, meaning that it is loading the cache and then will export. Your computer is probably lower end so it is taking a while to load all 300k files caches into memory. You simply need to wait for it to finish.</p>

I&#39;ll try uninstalling and reinstalling Black Ops 3 off of my desktop and see if that fixes it. <br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT #3: It seems as though uninstalling and reinstalling Black Ops 3 on my desktop did the trick. It took less than a second for Dempsey&#39;s model to be exported. I&#39;ll leave this post up here just in case someone else runs into the same problem.</p>

Wraith exports whats required for each model.<br /><br />If you want to rip skins, just take them from the XPAKs using wraith. Otherwise, it uses some of the old masks from the BASE model.</p>

<p>Reply By: Tosyk<br />So if I see mask texture ingame it&#39;s not guarantee that I can export it with Wraith? because this is exactly what happening.<br /><br /><br /><br />p.s.: no, seriously, why can Wraith skip all the mipmaps on extracting except the highest?</p>

So you need to rip the base model and the skin to see everything properly. just rip do a format other than DDS to skip mipmaps. You can&#39;t open most of the DDS&#39;s anyways.</p>

Also there&#39;s a lot of models presented just body parts of the ruin character but still with suffix &quot;_skinX&quot;.<br /><br />I never use dds!

Mipmaps are levels in a DDS with different resolutions.<br /><br />You need to export each part of the ruin character. I don&#39;t know the names.</p>

<p>Reply By: mikey<br />Anyone who gets the error message in the above post, here is a work around.<br /><br /><br /><br />I believe it is a issue with Wraith&#39;s &quot;temp&quot; gdt&#39;s (aka the list of extracted items in the &quot;manage gdt&quot; portion of the program) and the way it works on overwriting existing material/gdt info as many maps share the same models.<br /><br /><br /><br />If you extract multiple maps from BO3 back to back, you will receive the error above.<br /><br /><br /><br />Only fix is after each map, is to go and save the gdt (if you are porting to BO3 or W@W), then after saving the gdt, restart Wraith and go to your next map so the list of extracted items in the gdt will clear.</p>
