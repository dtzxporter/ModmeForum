<p>Thread By: TrueGamerCalls<br />The zones and everything were set up correctly (Zombies will spawn in a area after I open it up) But now none of my zombies move after spawning (Even start_zone zombies) This only occured after I added a debris. Is there anything I might&#39;ve screwed up?</p>

Just Riser spawns. I mean Debris as a door.</p>
