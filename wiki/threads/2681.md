<p><span style="color:#00ffff;">ABNORMAL202 SCRIPTING TUTORIAL 0: Installing Sublime</span><br /> <br /><a href="https://forum.modme.co/threads/abnormal202-scripting-tutorials-master.2680/">See ALL Tutorials</a><br /> <br />This one shouldn&#39;t take long, as its not actual scripting but something pretty much <strong>everyone</strong> should do before starting scripting.<br /> <br />Basically when we are scripting, we have to open up many different files such as .gsc&#39;s, .csc&#39;s, .gsh&#39;s, etc. using a text editor. <strong>Sublime</strong> will be our text editor.<br /> <br />Most people choose Sublime for this because Treyarch was kind enough to leave us with a <strong>Sublime Package</strong> that allows auto-highlighting for .gsc files in Sublime which is really nice.<br /> <br /> <br /><span style="color:#00ffff;">HOW TO INSTALL</span><br /> <br />First, download the text editor Sublime for free from the <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Website.</a><br /> <br />Once you have that installed, locate the package Treyarch left us, called gsc_sublime.zip. This is located in (Bo3Root\docs_modtools)<br /> <br />In a separate folder window, locate where Sublime is installed (most likely in C:\Program Files\Sublime Text 3\Packages). copy &amp; paste the gsc_sublime.zip folder into this folder.<br /> <br />Rename gsc_sublime.zip to GSC.sublime-package<br /> <br />You will have to restart Sublime if you have it open. Then whenever you open a .gsc file (or any file you want the GSC highlighting for) you can select &quot;GSC&quot; in the bottom right corner of Sublime:<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://imgur.com/CjNQU7j.png"><br /> <br />And you should be good &amp; ready to script! <br /> <br />From now on when opening files for text editing, make sure to use Sublime and <strong>not</strong> notepad or whatever default text editor it may recommend.<br /> <br /><a href="https://forum.modme.co/threads/abnormal202-scripting-tutorials-master.2680/">See ALL Tutorials</a></p>
