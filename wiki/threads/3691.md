<p>I am new to mapping and I am making my first map, out of nowhere when I load in the game, there seems like there&#39;s some sort of missing textures. The brushes are still there, you can shoot them and you can see the particle effects from the bullets hitting it. <br /><br />I tried re exporting the lighting, re applying the textures, making the sun volume bigger. I am not sure what caused this either.<br /><br />Any help will be highly appreciated, thank you<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1117.png' | relative_url }}"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1118.png' | relative_url }}"></p>

<p>You most likely have those surfaces flipped or caulked (or both)</p>
