<p>How would I go about teleporting all players to four structs once a trigger is activated? I&#39;ve tried using SetOrigin for the player but that wouldn&#39;t teleport every player in the match. any help appreciated!!</p>

<p>foreach(player in GetPlayers())<br />    player setOrigin((x,y,z))</p>

<p><blockquote>foreach(player in GetPlayers())<br />    player setOrigin((x,y,z))<br /></blockquote><br /><br />thank you! Wouldn&#39;t that spawn all players in the same spot and cause issues? How would I spawn them on four different structs?</p>
