<p>Thread By: TemporalPick<br />Hi there, I&#39;m looking to replace voice lines/sounds in some of the official maps but can&#39;t find any guides on how to do so. I was told it was possible but it&#39;s incredibly hard to find out how. Any help would be appreciated, and the main focus is the voice lines for a map.</p>

<p>Reply By: modric<br />I think you could just replace the sounds provided in the wiki&#39;s der eisendrache vox pack, just rename your sounds to the sounds provided in the castle alias</p>
