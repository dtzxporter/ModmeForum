<p>Thread By: BlackMamba231<br />So for my map I&#39;m trying to make a Cabin but I can&#39;t figure out the best way to make one. Is it using models or using brushes? Because brushes don&#39;t make it look realistic enough and with models I get stuck when adding a door because it doesn&#39;t fit in well. Any help or tips would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Reply By: Wild<br />I&#39;d layout the cabin with brushes so you have the correct scale and layout that you&#39;re looking for. Next I would keep the floor brush and just texture that how you want but for the walls you can add log models over the brush trying to scale the models to look how you want and to fit the size of the brush you already created. Finally you could remove the brush all together. Pretty simple but it works. Just make sure to add a clip on the walls so players can&#39;t walk through.</p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />You could make Cylinders, and give them a wood texture, then just stack those up like how a real cabin would look like.</p>
