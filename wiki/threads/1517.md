<p>Thread By: Lethal Peelz<br />I don&#39;t know what i&#39;m doing wrong but every time i try and port the mw2 ranger this happens<br /> <br /> <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/lN50Yjy.jpg"><br /> <br />I have tried porting this weapon 3 times in a row and for some reason it only seems to happen with the ranger.</p>

<p>Reply By: Spherical_Dood<br />check your viewmodel. Is there a option ticked that says in parentheses (Not Viewmodel)?</p>
