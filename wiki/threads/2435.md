<p>Sorry for reviving such an old thread, but was wondering if someone could help me with a potential issue I&#39;m having regarding porting CoD2 weapons. While following the instructions, whenever I use the Xmodel Exporter tool to view the tags for a specific model, this is what I get: <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/b2019fa17d0bf2c3a57e6221f943e244.png"><br /><br />Surely all of the joints shouldn&#39;t be positioned at 0.00, right? I&#39;ve tried this for several models, and the majority of them have the same issue. Any help would be greatly appreciated!<br /><br />UPDATE: This doesn&#39;t look quite right to me...<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/630b9b0a55806bb2c0bb19679098f735.png"></p>
