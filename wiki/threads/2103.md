<p>Thread By: jackabob<br />Hey all, I need help with 2 models, <strong>p7_aqu_wire_bundle_01_ceiling_bracket</strong> and <strong>p7_aqu_wire_bundle_01_wall_bracket</strong>. In radiant they look fine and usable but in-game, the lower bar piece of the bracket does not render in. It is rather frustrating and I was wondering: is this an issue on my end or is it the model itself and if it is on my end how do I go about fixing it? All help is appreciated</p>

<p>Reply By: Fil he Modder<br />some models that have shipped with the tools may have some missing textures or materials. I&#39;d advise you to go into bo3 and export the model and copy over the textures etc</p>
