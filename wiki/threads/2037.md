<p>Thread By: Zixology<br />I haven&#39;t had this issue before. I&#39;ve been using custom .wav files up to this point just fine with no format issues. I use 32-bit at 48000hz and now my new ones result in an error saying that &quot;wav is not format 1 or 0xFFFE&quot;. Can anyone help and/or tell me what I did wrong this time that I apparently did right last time?</p>

I just tried that and still nothing. I don&#39;t get the error anymore. But now it just plays the old file I used to have. I don&#39;t even know where it&#39;s getting the old file since I replaced it. This isn&#39;t making any sense.</p>

<p>Reply By: Zixology<br />I actually just did another test. Cause I got some of the files working in the past.<br />I just reverted back and loaded/linked all the old files and it&#39;s still using some of the &quot;newer ones&quot; if that makes sense.<br />Meaning that all these file changes have been being ignored by the mod tools. So I just need to figure out why it&#39;s ignoring them.</p>

<p>Reply By: The Black Death<br />If you encounter *any* errors during snd_convert, regardless of whether it is related to the specific sound you want to edit, *no* sounds will update.</p>
