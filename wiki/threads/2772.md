<p>I&#39;ve had this error multiple times, everytime I just undo some changes and the error is gone. But now I&#39;m really stuck. Ive looked online but I seem to be the only one to ever have this error.<br />I heard it may have something to do with brushes? idk<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.175.png' | relative_url }}"></p>

<p>When you load the map into radiant, what does the log say ? (Press O)<br />Look for an error in there, or post the log if you want. At a very wild (and possibly inaccurate) guess, you maybe have two brushes or meshes on top of each other, both with diffuse maps.</p>

Atleast from my experience</p>
