<p>Thread By: Zixology<br />Just made some changes (radiant only) to my map. Added some probes, brushes and patches. Map compiles just fine with no errors. I go to run it and I get a black screen right before BO3 just closes. No error message or anything. It just closes out as if I alt+F4. All other maps work fine. I have no clue what&#39;s causing this.</p>

<p>Reply By: Symbo<br />You might have delete something by accident. I know there are some ways to search for the error trough logfile, developer mode etc...<br />You can also look for an autosave in roots/radiant/auto_save and overwrite the one in roots/map_source/zm</p>
