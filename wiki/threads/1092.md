<p>Thread By: ltschase<br />So my user_aliases.csv is not working AT ALL now. Wondering what all it could possibly be. No ported weapons have sound anymore or anything like that. Been struggling to try to figure this out all night, and I am sure it is something silly that is causing it. Thanks ahead of time.</p>

You&#39;ll hit the limit for having too many things installed such as ported weapons, perks, round sounds, boss zombies, etc... Try removing some aliases and see if new ones start to work.</p>

Must be a way around that....right?<br />Also, removed all from my user_aliases.csv except for 26 weapons.....still none of those work.</p>

You could try verifying the integrity of the tools and remove the aliases and reinstall the weapons. That has happened to me where I install something and the sound doesn&#39;t work but if I remove the aliases, recompile and link, then reinstall the weapon the sounds work. It&#39;s weird.</p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />I know that just one broken sound can ruin the entire Alias. Look carefully in launcher and look for any warnings or errors pertaining to user_aliases.csv.</p>

Actually may just try adding one at a time either way, only takes a minute to link and test.</p>
