Did you make a user_alias.csv reference in your mapname.szc file? (I think I forgot that step) To do it, copy/paste a complete reference in there and place it in the middle under one. Like how you do in Harry&#39;s pack. Then name the file used as user_alias.csv<br /> <br />EDIT: Nope, its in there by default so idk what the issue would be. Did you properly include the aliases in the csv? I know it works with harrys pack as he has the exact same aliases. I don&#39;t know how it wouldnt work this way.<br /> <br />Also did you compile after installing lol.</p>

They have not been added without the aliases names.Also i didn&#39;t just add the shield sounds. I also included pick up sounds for the shields, and the building sound for the crafting instead of just knuckles crackling. Also this was a fix that was for when their was no dlc gun sounds at all. This fixed alot of them, and still has alot of other sounds. Including pap sounds.</p>

<p>Reply By: awesomeguy42<br />Is it just me, or is one of the sounds for the Wunderwaffe DG-2 missing? I compared the mod tools&#39; firing to The <br />Giant&#39;s, and it sounds slightly different.</p>

<p>Reply By: awesomeguy42<br />Yo, as it turns out, whoever did this missed a ton of files by looking only in the folder for GK, and not the folder for multiplayer patches. Hell, there&#39;s even a loop for PaP&#39;d shooting in there. Does anyone know how to add in an alias/script for starting and stopping sounds? The release this guy made didn&#39;t include them, and only has a looping mode, which sounds really bad when you shoot one round at a time. Also your Mk3 noises are way too loud, I suggest adjusting the audio next time.</p>

Could try and edit them in audacity later.</p>

You have different firing sounds, but the upgrade lacks the distinct &quot;pew pew&quot; sound, which I find baffling, because the upgrade fire sound <br />is easily accessible in the game&#39;s files. I&#39;d implement it myself, but I&#39;m a dumbass and can&#39;t script for shit.</p>
