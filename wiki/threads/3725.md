<p>Pretty interesting! Will the boss always hit the player? It seems like you weren&#39;t able to dodge any of its &quot;acid&quot; shots. I know you weren&#39;t trying to dodge but, even when you weren&#39;t standing still, you were constantly getting nailed.<br />The blasting the shield section reminded me of spaceland and the ufo haha <br />I&#39;d raise the boss a tad, if possible. His arms clip through the ground a lot.</p>

<p>The mechanic is that we are always taking damages but we just have to see our shield melee : when he is more than 0 we take 40 damages melee and 10 damages by range , when the shield is 0 we take 200 damages in melee and 1 in range :)</p>
