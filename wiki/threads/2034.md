<p>Thread By: AAAA<br />I&#39;ve looked around and gotten help with this from a couple places but haven&#39;t had any luck with it working. What I want to do is have a simple weapon mod that puts my custom guns into ANY official map. Right I can give them to myself through the console but I cant PaP them or ever get them from the mystery box. I know I have to have <br /> <br />load_weapon_spec_from_table(&quot;gamedata/weapons/zm/zm_WEAPONCSVNAME.csv <br /> <br />in a gsc and csc, but because I don&#39;t have a map, just a mod, there isn&#39;t even a scripts folder. So far I have tried the following: creating a gsc and csc and pasting in that line, replace the name of the weapon csv in the zm_usermaap csc and gsc and then putting <br /> <br />scriptparsetree,scripts/zm/zm_usermap.gsc<br />scriptparsetree,scripts/zm/zm_usermap.csc<br /> <br />in my zone file after <br /> <br />stringtable,gamedata/weapons/zm/zm_WEAPONCSVNAME.csv<br /> <br />and also attempting to put the table code inside cscs and gsc that should always be loaded like powerups but still have had no luck. What could I be doing wrong?</p>

<p>Reply By: Fil he Modder<br />all i can suggest is using the same zm_weaponcommon.csv by copying them over to each of your map files, you can leave the name as default, if you rename it to something like test_weapons.csv, then they won&#39;t work, also for the upgraded versions; make sure you have a weaponname_upgraded in that csv file, also you&#39;ll have to make an upgraded version yourself in APE such as making a camo table, names, damage etc.</p>
