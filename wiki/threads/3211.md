<p>I&#39;ve been wanting to make a lunar lander or helicopter that would take you into the map, drop you off, fly away and never come back. I just don&#39;t know how I would do it. If anyone could help me or lead me in the right direction that would be appreciated! (the only reason I put this post here is because Logical Edits told me it would take more radiant work)<br />If you want to dm me, here&#39;s my discord. <span style="color:rgb(247, 218, 100);">RllyyTwitchyy.gsc#6608</span></p>
