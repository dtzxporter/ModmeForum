<p>Thread By: Dick_Nixon<br />I&#39;m trying to export Electric Cherry, and neither the models, nor the images export. I&#39;ve followed the suggested help on the Wraith Knowledge base, and nothing has worked. I&#39;ve verified my game cache, I&#39;ve run wraith in administrator, I&#39;ve reinstalled both programs multiple times, and absolutely nothing is working. The only things I have selected are the .XMODEL_EXPORT and the &quot;export images with models&quot; options. does anyone know how to solve this?</p>

<p>Reply By: Dick_Nixon<br />I know it&#39;s not my firewall, because I&#39;ve been able to export from both BO1 and BO3. And I check the logs, and it states that they&#39;ve been exported, it even makes a new exported files folder, but nothing happens.</p>

If you haven&#39;t restarted your PC recently, do so. Finally, you also have to own the DLC on steam, (Can&#39;t use pirated DLC&#39;s).</p>

<p>Reply By: Dick_Nixon<br />I just tried to export the M1911, both using and not using wraith in administrator, and nothing exported except empty files.<br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT : I do own the DLC legitimately.</p>

<p>Reply By: DTZxPorter<br />Try exporting the MA formats and or disabling image export, Just confirmed that me and others can export no problem.</p>

<p>Reply By: Dick_Nixon<br />I Exported both the m1911 and Electric cherry in .MA (with and without any image options on) and got the models successfully without image options on. How do I get the image files for them?</p>

<p>Reply By: DTZxPorter<br />Something is blocking your PC from allowing the image tool to work, I have no clue what it is or why it&#39;s happening. You are the only person with this issue unfortunately. The only other thing I can say is try installing <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784</a> (Both x86 and x64 versions), restarting, and trying to export images.</p>
