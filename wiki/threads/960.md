<p>Reply By: CaptainHT<br />Have two or more power switch prefabs, one switch in one zone, and another switch in another zone. Stamp both of the power switch prefabs. (Click prefab at the top and click &quot;stamp.&quot;) Then add a Kvp, The property/ key needs to be &quot;Script_int,&quot; while the value needs to be &quot;power_zone.&quot; After you are done with this, have anything that requires power in your desired zone. After you have put your Perk or Pack a Punch machine in the desired zone, stamp the perk or pap. Then go to your perk machine or pack a punch and add a kvp. The same as before the property/key needs to be &quot;Script_int,&quot; while the value needs to be &quot;power_zone.&quot; Save then compile and run your map. Then you should have multiple power switches in your map.<br /> <br />P.S. I haven&#39;t tested, but you should have to put a variable after the &quot;power_zone&quot; for example: &quot;power_zone_a&quot; It should work. But you can experiment with this.</p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />Get 2 power switch prefabs and stamp them. Remove the structs (or you&#39;ll get client field mismatch). Change the targetnames of the triggers to elec_switch1 and elec_switch2. Change the handle models into a script_models and change their targetnames to elec_switch_handle1 and elec_switch_handle2. Copy paste this code in to your mapname.gsc<br /> <br /> <br />in function main(), under zm_usermap::main();<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
thread power();

<p>Reply By: itznvy<br />Script works. Only issue, however it is small is that whenever you flip the switches for power they don&#39;t move up like they did before. My guess is because you said to remove the script_struct. +1 win.</p>
