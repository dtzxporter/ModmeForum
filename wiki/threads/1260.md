<p>Reply By: TrueGamerCalls<br /> <br />You can change the &quot;1000&quot; to any score you want, or change the &quot;+&quot; to a &quot;-&quot; to minus points<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
// Put in main
thread moneyscript();

// Put at the bottom of GSC
function moneyscript()
{
 shoot = GetEnt("shoot", "targetname");
 shootm = GetEnt("shootm", "targetname");
 shoot waittill( "trigger", player );
 player PlaySound("insertsoundalies");
 player.score += 1000;
 shoot Delete();
 shootm Delete();
}

// Put a trigger damage over the model you want to use, and put the targetname "shoot" and put the model as a script model, then give it a targetname of "shootm"
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
