<p>Hello!<br /><br />For my custom map, I want to have an area where the zombies would start sprinting after a few seconds but when you head to the real spawn area of the map, they walk at normal speeds again. Essentially, Round 1 doesn&#39;t start until you head to a teleporter and spawn into the spawn room.<br /><br />Is this possible to do with Black Ops 3&#39;s scripting or not?</p>
