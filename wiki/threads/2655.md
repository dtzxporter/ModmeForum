<p>I&#39;ve done a tutorial on this.<br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qKFMmCTjv-k" frameborder="0"></iframe><br />The code is pretty outdated but works fine. If you have any trouble lmk.<br />I might make a much better version of this script in future.</p>

Version 1 is just pick up and place, version 2 waits untill the power is on then it will show the model to be picked up and placed somewhere. You can change the models and everything</p>
