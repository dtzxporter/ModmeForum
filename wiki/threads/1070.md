<p>Thread By: DarkCry9000<br />Wondering if it is possible to set up a timed round for a boss round. Basically rather than having kills change the round, you have to just live through it. I assume continous spawning and a timer is doable i just don&#39;t know about adding it as a boss round. Second, to encourage players to actually kill the zombies rather than run trains and avoid them, is it possible to set up a sort of counter that counts the current zombies in an area or trigger and as more zombies come in display a screen/hud effect (maybe adding smoke or darkening the area or something). Lastly if too many zombies are in the area/trigger is it possible to kill all players? Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
