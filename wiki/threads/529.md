<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />I had a problem like that. I think that the game thinks you can&#39;t see behind the model so it just doesn&#39;t render stuff behind it. Probably some material setting in APE<br /> <br />Same happens with &quot;<span style="color:#ff9900;">bog_wood_window_shutter_open_single_01</span>&quot; if you want to compare</p>
