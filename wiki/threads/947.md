All you need to do is edit it so it drops like normal powerups. go to ROOT/raw/scripts/zm/ and open _zm_powerup_free_perk.gsc. Find:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
&amp;zm_powerups::func_should_never_drop
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
and replace it with:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
&amp;zm_powerups::func_should_always_drop
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
I&#39;m not sure if this works, but it makes sense that it should. Try it out and tell me if it drops free perk powerups like normal.</p>
