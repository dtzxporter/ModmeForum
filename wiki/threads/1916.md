<p>Thread By: ZombieKid164<br /><span style="text-decoration: line-through">Now whenever I try to run my map, I die on startup. Not sure what I did as it was working fine before, and when I removed what I had recently added, I still died. I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s not a zoning problem because all my zones are still there. Any help is greatly appreciated as I have been working on my map for over 3 months and I do not want to stop because of this. Thanks!</span><br /> <br />Nevermind</p>

That fixed it. Not sure why exactly that caused me to <strong>die</strong> on startup instead of just erroring, but that fixed it.</p>
