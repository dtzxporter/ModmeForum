<p>Reply By: Wild<br />There isn&#39;t really an easy way to do it unfortunately. You have to rip the models and animation from either BO1 Shangri la or the BO3 version, set them and the fx up and then script it all. I also don&#39;t think editing NSZ&#39;s script would help because you&#39;d be deleting and re writing massive parts of the script anyway. I would use it as a reference for things like spawning the zombie and all that but yeah, there&#39;s not an &quot;easy&quot; way of doing it :/</p>
