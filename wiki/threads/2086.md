<p>Thread By: ZombieKid164<br />Hello. I&#39;m getting back into modding again and in the map I am working on, the zombies won&#39;t track the player for some reason. I used the original spawners that come with the template map which <em>did </em>work at some point, but now they don&#39;t. Risers spawn and don&#39;t move but window zombies go to the window, break down the boards, climb through, then fly back into the area they were in. Both still attack, it&#39;s just that they should move. <br /> <br />Here&#39;s a GIF that shows my problem: <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/54e3b116ddb8a4498bb20276ea64291a.gif"><br /> <br />Not sure what I did, might be something stupid but thanks if you can help me<br /> <br />Edit: Here&#39;s a screenshot of what window zombies do<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/485cdeeca210f7a3b277e6a2358e9b55.gif"><br /> <br />Another Edit: The window ones (shown above) DO track the player once they go back inside the window area... not sure why but maybe this helps to find the problem?</p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />1) How do zombies go back in to the windowed area?<br />2) Maybe you deleted your nav volume.<br />3) If the area is separated from the rest of the map (either have to jump high or teleport or something (so zombies can&#39;t get there from the main part of the map)) then add a node_pathnode to the area.</p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />Did you accidentally wall off you big red rectangle (came with the spawns)? Zombies have to be able to path to it otherwise they freeze</p>

<p>Reply By: ZombieKid164<br />Nevermind, I just started a new map file and the problem seems to be gone.</p>
