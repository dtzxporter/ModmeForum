<p>Thread By: ordinarynoob<br />im using greyhound to rip black ops 4 models and basically some of them extract fine and some not. what i mean is the ones that dont extract properly are ones with a white texture colour issue to them, part of the model will have its original texture colours but then other parts just pure white, thats not right. i wanna know what im doing wrong and why it extracts white textures. ive just come back to ripping from the game again and even with updates to greyhound im still getting this issue when trying to rip the character zero.</p>

<p>Reply By: Scobalula<br />Because like Black Ops 3 they use a skinning system which means you need to manually find the texture/s, they are not apart of the model assets.</p>
