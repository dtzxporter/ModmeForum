<p>After 20 hours of not being able to figure out why none of my sounds are linking and loading into my map i&#39;m ready to pay a professional,</p>

<p>My guess would be to delete your snd sabs and recompile  but I dunno for sure and no money necessary if it works lol</p>

<p>the sabs automatically regenerate after a bunch of compiles it would help if i knew what youve added some alias you find in on the web <br />have <br /><br />#name<br />#name<br /><br />then <br />the user alias properties here<br />this causes a error <br />while the # = ignore similar to // to comment out at the top it causes shit to break well in my experience any ways</p>

<p>In here are the files u needed to delete to do this test.<br /><br />D:\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops III\usermaps\  YOUR MAP NAME HERE  \sound\zone\CachedBanks<br /><br />they will regenerate if no sound is playing then its another issue</p>

<p>i want to add to CaramelFudge&#39;s comment:<br />also delete all folders inside &quot;usermaps/zm_yourmap/zone/snd&quot; and then try to compile again. if it doesn&#39;t work the first time try to compile it a second time.<br /><br />if you get an error message like this during linking (i dont know the exact message): &quot;snd_convert.exe - Object reference not set to an instance of an object.&quot; then try to comment out the sound/alias it&#39;s referring to from your sound aliases file. keep commenting out the aliases it has problems with until you don&#39;t get this message anymore. If you get this error the sound converter will stop linking any of the sounds after this point.<br /><br />I guess this is obvious but i&#39;ll say it anyway just in case: make sure that your .szc file is valid (check the spelling of your aliases file etc.)<br /><br />If none of this works here is the hard way: Create a new aliases file, put in 2 or 3 sounds, delete all sound files that me and CaramelFudge mentioned and try linking 1 or 2 times. If those 2-3 sounds are working then try putting in your aliases in smaller steps. let&#39;s say if you have 600 lines than try adding 200 or 100 at a time, compile and check if it works. If at some point it stops working it will help you to nail down the problem.<br /><br />It&#39;s not necessary but would help a lot if you just share your sound alias file and maybe also your szc file here.</p>
