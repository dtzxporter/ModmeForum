Once there open the folder named &quot;autosave_backup&quot;. From there you can try using the older saves of your map and see if it works. Since these are autosaves there shouldn&#39;t be many changes to the map depending on what save you&#39;re using, I would recommend going 3 or 4 saves back and trying that one.<br /> <br />If you don&#39;t know how to use the autosave just find the .map for you map that has the most recent dates. Copy them to your desktop for example. Go to your Black Ops 3 ROOT, open map_souce, then open zm and in there take your map file and move it to somewhere else. Now drag the back up .map file in there and change the name to remove the date so it should just be called zm_yourmap. Then open it in radiant like normal.<br /> <br />See if that works :)</p>

It&#39;s happened a few times to me where I get the same error you did, or my brush isn&#39;t solid and when I touch it in game it causes visual glitches. As to why it happens, no idea. But for when it does now you know how to fix it lol</p>
