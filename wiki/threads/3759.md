<p>How hard is it to set up character quotes from a map other than the usual DE? I have powerup ammo and box quotes working and a few others, just because they work with the DE csv template, but don&#39;t know how to link up any of the other stuff. What am I looking at here? How do I know what to put in that csv to have it use all the other quotes?</p>

<p>so its pretty confusing when youre new to that stuff, however there are 2 files you want to be looking at for that: the one inside root/gamedata/audio/zm/zm_vox_de or whatever, and the one in root/share/raw/sound/aliases/zm_vox_de_alias or whatever it is.<br /><br />if you want to use different maps vox, you have to export those 2 files Hydra, and export all the sounds themselves with wraith.<br /><br />after youve done that make sure your map is looking for those files instead of the DE files (so thatll be defined in your map&#39;s gsc with zm_audio::loadPlayerVoiceCategories(&quot;gamedata/audio/zm/zm_castle_vox.csv&quot;);<br />and in your zone to define the gamedata/audio file with stringtable,gamedata/audio/zm/zm_castle_vox.csv)<br /><br />let me know if you have any questions or whatever, hmu on discord</p>
