<p>I installed wardogs perks on my map, which replaces the perk bottle sprites. But then i installed Planet&#39;s Bo4 perk bottle sprites yet the game still uses the wardog sprites, how can i get it to pick the Planet sprites? (mainly asking about the default non-wardog perks, but if you happen to know how to replace the sprites for the wardog perks i would appreciate the information.)</p>
