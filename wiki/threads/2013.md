<p>Thread By: modric<br />I have an area far away from the rest of my map that you teleport to, like Gorod Krovi. When I get there, the zombies spawn in that zone fine, but dont path to their barriers properly at all. I think the script needs some sort of line to set the paths of the zombies so they actually chase players. Heres the script<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
function player_teleporter_init()
{
	player_tp = GetEntArray( "teleport_player", "targetname" );
	for( i = 0; i &lt; player_tp.size; i++ )
	{
		player_tp[i] thread player_teleport();
	}
}

function player_teleport()
{
	destination = GetEnt( self.target, "targetname" );
	while(1)
	{
		self waittill( "trigger", player );
		player SetOrigin( destination.origin );
		player SetPlayerAngles( destination.angles );
	}
}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
</p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />are the zombies just standing in place? if that&#39;s the case it probably means the zombies cannot path to the info_player_start (that big red rectangle the comes with the spawn points). Zombies must always have a path to the info_player_start, even if you have to make one out of ai_clips.</p>

<p>Reply By: modric<br />No they dont, the area is completely seperate from the starting area. will they act normal with the ai clip thing stretching to the start room then?</p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br /><blockquote><em>modric</em><br />No they dont, the area is completely seperate from the starting area. will they act normal with the ai clip thing stretching to the start room then?</blockquote><br /> they should. They just need a path to the info_player_start. If you don&#39;t want them to actually ever use that path, you might have to make a script that teleports them when they start walking on it.</p>

<p>Reply By: modric<br />Harry suggested I use <br />this line for my easter egg door script so zombies wouldnt freak out when i went beyond the door. would this be applicable here too?<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
entity connectPaths()
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />incorrect, you need to place the zombie &quot;distraction points&quot; around the map - if they cant path to you, they will path to them, if they still cant path to you for too long - a failsafe will force respawn them<br /> <br />read the giant scripts people</p>

Is it a script struct?</p>
