<p>Thread By: mathfag<br />Part of my map is made up of basically only terrain patches and the problem is that I can walk/fall through a certain area in the patch. For example I have a pyramid shape and I can walk in to it from one side but not from the other sides.</p>

<p>Reply By: Fil he Modder<br />make sure you&#39;re not standing on a blend texture, because if you have a patch that only has a blend texture assigned to it then you&#39;ll just fall through the floor, try that.</p>

For example the normal texture could be called dirt_01, but the blend texture would be called dirt_01_blend. If all the textures in a specific spot have &quot;_blend&quot; in them then you will fall through them.You need at least one of the textures to not be a blend texture (doesn&#39;t have &quot;blend&quot; in the name, that&#39;s the easiest way to tell). Blend textures can still be a lit_detail</p>
