<p>Thread By: ZombieKid164<br />I am making the motd electric chairs in my map and I was wondering if there was a way to set the player pose to that of a model I set up with the pose manipulator, or something like that. Basically how do you set the pose of the player and what do you use to make the pose is my question. Any help would be great. Thanks. <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://aviacreations.com/modme/emoticons/smile.png"></p>
