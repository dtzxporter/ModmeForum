If that&#39;s wrong then sorry, I tried lol</p>

That way once you leave the prefab you can move it all at once still without going in and selecting every little part. Besides that yeah, just enter the prefab and resize everything. May be a bit of work but it&#39;s better than starting from scratch.</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />short answer<br /><br />no<br /><br />you need to enter the prefab and manually resize everything and then re-allign it as everything would have been based on a centre point</p>
