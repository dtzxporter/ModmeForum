<p>Thread By: ItalianMilkMan<br />I dragged and dropped the buried all models pack that was released by someone on this forum (forgot their name) and its got a lot of duplicate images and a few assets and materials. I was wondering what is the quickest way to remove these duplicates using APE.<br /> <br />I get 2,241 errors everytime I load up mod tools but I can still build my map if I select &quot;ignore errors&quot;, so will it matter or have any negative effect if I just leave all these duplicates and continue to ignore them?<br /> <br />Thanks everyone!</p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />Get makecents&#39; launcher <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCkAP2UBq_Q">YT link</a><br /> <br />open it and click on the GTD icon on the far right.<br /> <br />Define your black ops 3 directory at the top and 1 slot below it drag and drop your gdt.<br />On the right you can select some options. After you do this just click analize (and delete)</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />id suggest doing it manually, it may delete the one thats set up &quot;correctly&quot; and leave one of the ones that were in a wraith gdt that are not set up right</p>
