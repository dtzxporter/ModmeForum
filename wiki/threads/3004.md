<p>You&#39;ve put two &quot;c&quot;s in &quot;scripts/zm/_zm_perk_doubletap2.gscc &quot;, take out the other c and that should fix it.</p>

<p>Mike_Fozzy had a good guess but he is wrong, all of the perks have .gscc in them (mine are working fine) So you have a different issue I would say.<br /><br />Go back through Harry&#39;s instructions and double check you didn&#39;t miss anything (not a single letter or symbol when you copied and pasted) and that you followed instructions and pasted in the right spot. If you are using Madgaz perks or Black ops 4 perks you may have replaced files that you needed and or needed to alter. Also make sure you have leakmod/LUA installed and followed those steps properly</p>

<p>Im not sure how it works but Leakmod is required (according to Harrys instructions) for this perk pack and you have to replace a file in your gamefiles (follow the leakmod instructions) but Im not sure if this is your problem but maybe.</p>

Dont override anyfiles when drag and dropping. I did and it caused map crashes and I had to reinstall harrys boxes.</p>

<p><blockquote>Even though i don&#39;t wamt Timeslip i still need Harry Boxes?<br /></blockquote><br /><br />No, that was just if you had harry&#39;s boxes from the wiki. Timeslip requires an altered box script or something like that (included with it).</p>

From my experience any crashes have been from my own error in following instructions. If you added anything else besides the perks check into that as well. Maybe one of the more experienced forum members will chime in to help you better than I can.</p>

<p><blockquote>don&#39;t worry about bro, you did the best you can. thank you .<br /></blockquote><br /><br />When all else fails you can always start over by saving as a new map.<br /><br />1) Open Mod Tools<br />2) Create a new zm mod level name it &quot;zm_yourmapname_fix&quot; (replace &quot;yourmapname&quot; with Your Map&#39;s name)<br />3) exit this new map in radiant<br />4) Load up your map you are trying to fix and save it as &quot;zm_yourmapname_fix&quot; (or whatever you named the new one in step 2)<br />5) If it asks say you want to override the existing map with the same name<br />6) CAREFULLY Re-install all of your scripts, perk packs, weapon packs (everything you had added to your map already)<br /><br />Then your scripts will be clean and new and you just carefully reinstall everything and you should be good to go. If you copy-paste everything from your old scripts you will just end up with your same problem, so reinstall everything one at a time.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also always a good idea to create backups of your stuff as you go along so you dont lose anything.</p>
