<p>I know that I have to edit the .csv file in game data folder, but that didn’t do the trick. I’m assuming I have to add the weapons into the zone files of the stock maps but I don’t know how to do that. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>The csv is only for the box / pap<br /><br />Include it like any other gun and make a way to get it or use the console<br /><br />Each map has its own box csv<br /><br />Eg nacht is<br /><br />Prototype_weapons.csv</p>

<p><blockquote>Rip them with hydra then reinclude them<br /><br />Add to the box or spawn them in the map or make an Easter egg?<br /></blockquote><br />So I could use the console to add weapons to box? And you’re referring to hydraX correct? Isn’t that just like wraith or am I mistaken?</p>

<p><blockquote>For<br /><br />for me, hydra doesn’t let me really do anything, unless I’m using it wrong<br /></blockquote><br />What about it doesn&#39;t work for you? does it not load assets? <br />It works pretty similar to greyhound/wraith. Load up the map you want to rip stuff from, then click the button in the top left corner. It looks like a stick of ram, or a comb haha.<br />All the different assets should load up and you can mass export them or just select the ones you want exported.</p>

<p>The main problem is when I downloaded the zip file, there is not application unless I&#39;m missing it.</p>

Okay after checking it seems there is no option to download the exe, at least not one I could find.<br />Here&#39;s a link to Hydra that I just uploaded.<br /><a href="https://mega.nz/file/rkRDVYaS#MwA59fGeL26RaACDk5xOFxZU56LLI-E78SmousXhh-o">https://mega.nz/file/rkRDVYaS#MwA59fGeL26RaACDk5xOFxZU56LLI-E78SmousXhh-o</a><br /><br />To Scob: if you see this post somehow and don&#39;t approve of me sharing the app, I will gladly remove it.

The only problem is that apparently it’s an outdated version of hydra so it doesn’t work on the current build of bo3 :/</p>

This is why you don&#39;t keep outdated versions of apps in the same folder as the new version haha. I updated the download, just click the link and give it another download. Sorry about that!<br />Edit. well the link wasn&#39;t downloading the proper update. Now it should be the right link haha</p>
