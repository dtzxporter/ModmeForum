<p>I’m having an issue where only the Gobblegum texture and PAP camo are not showing up in game. The gun looks normal and the gumball is just white. I had at first figured it might have to do with the lighting but I copied the skybox over to a new map and both textures showed up just fine.<br /><br />   I’ve looked everywhere for a possible fix and have found nothing. If anyone could help it would be greatly appreciated!</p>
