<p>Thread By: modric<br />Map is almost done and i made some tiny changes in gsc and radiant and wanted to test it and for whatever reason compiling isnt working properly. it takes 15 minutes just to link, and longer than that to compile/lights. if i try to do all 3 at once it never finishes compiling. attempting to play the map in bo3 crashes the game. i have no errors in my launcher, is there somewhere else i can look for a possible error?</p>

<p>Reply By: modric<br />Yes i actually did, I added craftd&#39;s hvk wallbuy. i was already using some of his other wallbuys so i dont know why that would break my map</p>
