<p>Thread By: TheRealHealz<br />So I&#39;m planning on making a new map based on another game. (kind off like the league of legends map) The main problem is that I&#39;ve gotten some of the models through NinjaRipper and I&#39;ve gotten them to work in APE, textures and all. The problem comes when I go into radiant and but them into the map, they aren&#39;t showing the textures in APE. I&#39;m gotten custom models also from the other game, but with a website and it works with no problem. Just to confirm it wasn&#39;t the game, I tried earlier versions of the game and even tried GTA San Andreas and still no luck. Can someone help me with this?</p>
