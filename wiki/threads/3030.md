<p>Can anyone help me with a zombie riser location which after spawning mantles over a clipped object? Thank you :)</p>

<p>just put the traversal near the zombie spawner (i used mantle) and stamp the prefab lol i thought it was more complicated but it was really that simple. Make sure the beginning node is by the spawner and the ending node is the opposite (where they will end up)</p>

<p>it doesn’t matter how close the spawner is - just check there is a nav mesh between the spawn point and the traverse and they will use it<br /><br />eg gorod krovi - the zombies spawn literally miles away<br /><br />if no nav mesh generates - place a path node in the effected area ( this is why there is a path node in the wall hop example prefab )</p>

Thanks!</p>
