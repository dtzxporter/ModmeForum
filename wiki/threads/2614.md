<p>Recently Radiant&#39;s began acting up. Models and textures randomly stop loading up in the browser and whenever I try to place something the app crashes. The same thing happens with certain models like the corrugated sheet metals even though those models load up in the browser. I&#39;ve tried looking around on APE to see if something&#39;s wrong and I&#39;ve tried reinstalling BO3 Modtools but nothing&#39;s worked so far.</p>

<p>Does this happen on a stock / new map?</p>

<p><blockquote>Does this happen on a stock / new map?<br /></blockquote><br />I noticed it on my work in progress map but I haven&#39;t checked to see if it&#39;s happening on any other maps I have yet.</p>

<p>It may be the GDTDB file, which you can safely delete and have rebuilt... Also, when reinstalling the modtools, I&#39;m guessing you just used steam. Steam won&#39;t delete anything that wasn&#39;t created by the installation, so changes that you&#39;ve made can still cause an issue.</p>

<p>How much VRAM &amp; RAM do you have? You might want to try increasing your pagefile as well.</p>

How would I go about deleting and rebuilding those files?</p>

<p>Only 4-8GB? I have 16GB of RAM and run out instantly with radiant. Make your pagefile 48-128GB, mines 128gb and still I manage to run out of memory sometimes lol.</p>

Once installed check if the clean version of the modtools works, if so, it&#39;s something you&#39;ve added.</p>

I just deleted the GDTDB file from the folder instead. Where in Steam do I have to go to reinstall it?</p>

If you want it fixed this is most likely what you&#39;ll have to endure.</p>

<p><blockquote>Does your laptop have a regular hdd?<br /></blockquote><br />It does not. Do you think doing the same steps with the GDTDB would work if I tried it with the Radiant files? Kind of like a reset feature?</p>

<p>I got the models working again, I just did the steps you said with the GDTDB to another folder that had the models in it. But now I&#39;m having computer problems so I can&#39;t use Steam or any other games  &#128557;  thanks for the help everyone :)(y)</p>
