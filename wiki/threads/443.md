<p>Thread By: yologirlgamer<br />Okay so i&#39;ve made a trigger to change the skybox but as we all know radiant is a little silly so lightning state 3 is lightning state 1 for me... But i&#39;m trying to make the trigger go to lightning state 3? anyone else have this problem? or know what I should do</p>

<p>Reply By: TrueGamerCalls<br />Please describe the issue more, are you trying to figure out what Lighting State 3 in radiant is in the script? If so you don&#39;t need to ask anyone, take your time and mess around with it in the script. I figured out LS3 was LS2 in the script. Its only 4 numbers to try out.</p>
