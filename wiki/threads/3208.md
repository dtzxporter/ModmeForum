<p>Hi all! I&#39;m having an issue that I&#39;m looking <em><strong>everywhere</strong></em> for a fix for but have found nothing on thus far. I&#39;m installing Skye&#39;s BO1 and BO2 weapons, added all the right lines to the proper places, followed the read me&#39;s to a T, and everything seems to be working launcher-wise except for a few files. the BO1 WA2000, BO1 python, BO1 AK47 and the BO2 M27 seem to all be having their own problems. The python and WA2000 are missing audio files according to the mod tools launcher, I check the directory and the files are there, playable and all, I checked the file names and everything and they&#39;re still throwing errors even after I replace them. (Another note - the errors aren&#39;t always there for the sound files either, sometimes they will be, and other times they won&#39;t be) The AK and the M27 both are apparently missing PaP camos, but the materials and everything are there and in the proper folder as well as far as I understand it.. (let me be clear - I DO NOT KNOW FOR SURE WHERE THOSE FILES ARE LOCATED, SO I MAY BE MISSING SOMETHING WITH THE MATS)  I&#39;ve tried replacing everything several times to no avail. I have BO3 guns all removed from my map as well, with the starting pistol being switched over to the BO1 1911 and have wall weapons to match, but when I finally load into my map, I have no gun and can&#39;t interact with anything but the power switch, but I can still throw grenades and knife. I genuinely have no idea what I could be doing wrong, any help would be greatly appreciated. Here&#39;s my launcher log. (I know I have a ton of other errors as well, ignore all those as I&#39;m still fairly new and learning - none of them have affected my map&#39;s playability)<br /><br />Image of my folder to show that the file is in fact in the correct place:<br />[ATTACH=full]683[/ATTACH]<br /><br /><br /><br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}

<p>I got the weapons fixed - still throwing errors in the launcher and I&#39;d still like to get those taken care of if possible!</p>

<p>I don&#39;t do ZM maps, but in any case... for the sounds..they probably just not set up in the user_aliases.csv file. Materials ? If it says it can&#39;t find them in the compiler, you sure as shit haven&#39;t set them up in APE either. So load ape, type in the texture and see what&#39;s going on..probably a wrong path.</p>
