<p>I was just wondering if it was possible to have two mystery boxes on one map. Like one box is the normal mystery box but the other box has different weapons in it and costs more.</p>

<p><blockquote>Theoretically.<br />I dont think anyone did it yet<br /></blockquote><br />So theoretically speaking, couldn&#39;t I just make another script similar to the mystery box and make another &quot;zm_levelcommon_weapons.csv&quot; for that box to read those weapons?<br />I have no clue, I&#39;m new to scripting.</p>
