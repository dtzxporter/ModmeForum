<p>Thread By: Penguinquasar<br />Hey,<br />So yeah Ape does not want to start for me ever since I added a new asset I ripped from BO2, I have deleted the asset and verified the tools through steam but no luck I also tried runing it from the directory.<br />Any ideas as to why it won&#39;t open for me?</p>
