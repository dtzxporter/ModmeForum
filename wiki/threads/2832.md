<p>Hi there,<br /><br />I am currently looking at getting a music box/menu into my zombies map very much like Minecraft V1.2 on Steam. There seems to be absolutely 0 tutorials online for it and seems so rare to come across. I know UGX made a jukebox but that is for WAW and would need an overhaul to get working in bo3. A link to his music box is <a href="http://tom-crowley.co.uk/downloads/?id=5">here</a>. Note: This link will auto download the .rar file! Does anybody have any ideas/suggestions or some form of guidance? It would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />The menu looks like this:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.282.jpg' | relative_url }}"><br /><br />Many thanks,Chief</p>
