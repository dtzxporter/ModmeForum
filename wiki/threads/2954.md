<p>Hey all,<br /><br />I was just curious to know if there is a foliage pack that im able to download that includes lots of plants, trees, bushes and things of that nature (no pun intended). I would like more variety in my map. Is there one available to download? If so, please be so kind to link it in your reply. <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />the_bibba_boy</p>

<p>You can use Wraith Archon to grab active models from the maps, including foliage.</p>
