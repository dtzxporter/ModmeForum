<p>Thread By: Lethal Peelz<br />I&#39;ve tried things like changing the ammo/clip names to 2 different names and tried putting _zm at the end of the names, but the main weapon and alt weapon will always share the same ammo. Anyone knows a fix?</p>

For example the wave gun from moon is an alt weapon to the zap guns</p>

Second, thanks, it works flawlessly now</p>
