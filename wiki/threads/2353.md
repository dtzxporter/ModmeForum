<p>hey man, noticed in the instructions.txt that there is a comma missing where u put the example of what we should put in the szc file:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
{
 "Type" : "ALIAS",
 "Name" : "user_aliases_dlc5zvox",
 "Filename" : "user_aliases_dlc5zvox.csv",
 "Specs" : [ ]
}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
should have a comma at the end. just thought i&#39;d let u know dude :)</p>
