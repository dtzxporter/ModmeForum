<p>Does anyone know how I can better understand how serverside and clientside scripts react with one another? I would say I&#39;m a pretty good scripter at this point but you can only go so far with serverside scripting and i want to branch out to make my scripts just that little bit better, but I cant seem to wrap my head around how to properly call functions from gsc to csc or initiate flags properly.<br /><br />any help or nudge would be appreciated :)</p>
