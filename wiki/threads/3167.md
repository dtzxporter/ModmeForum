<p>Haven&#39;t had this issue before, randomly started seemingly for no reason as well. Was wondering if anybody has experienced this before ans knows how to fix it?<br /><br />I boot up into the game fine, no worries there, but there is no round counter, no zombie spawns, etc.</p>

<p>Turns out I had the answer right in front of me hah, I somehow had accidentally deleted my spawner</p>
