<p>I&#39;d like to know how to export the scripting of BO2 zombie behavior. I noticed that BO2 zombies act differently from BO3 zombies, they run slower, take more time to hit, shorter hit range and more importantly take up less space making smaller hordes and training in close quarters easier. If exporting is not necessary, then how do I go about changing the script of the zombies to be more like BO2.</p>

<p>You know how you need the behavior script for brutus to work, that&#39;s what I want with zombies from bo2</p>
