<p>Thread By: andy6170<br />Hey everyone,<br /> <br />I have been able to get a GDT created with custom zombie models and got them working however is there a way to set specific spawn locations with set models like in Origins where in the trenches it&#39;s the normal zombie models and underground there are the crusader styled ones that spawn there. I&#39;ve had a look around and not been able to find this. Any help is appreciated :)</p>
