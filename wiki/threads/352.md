<p>Thread By: FiveSeven<br /><p style="text-align:left;">So Im just messing around and trying to make the mp combine map into a zombies map but it I cant find where its calling the scripts in radiant. When I try to run the game it says im missing script files such as mp_combine.gsc and im not sure where it is calling it from.  I deleted everthing in the map and stamped all of the prefabs. when looking in my entity list i only have fx and models left.  </p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">I just imported onto a new map and compiled and it is working fine now.  </p><p style="text-align:left;"></p></p>
