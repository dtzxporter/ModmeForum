<p>Thread By: h00dedsn1per<br />Hello, I&#39;m looking for someone who has a good understanding of scripting in BO3 to help create an easter egg for my current zombies map I&#39;m working on. I am terrible at scripting myself and I also don&#39;t currently have the time to learn to script for BO3 at the moment, therefore I am hoping for someone who can assist me in creating an easter egg quest for my map. The easter egg is fairly short and not very complex. Whoever helps will be credited of course. I won&#39;t share the actual easter egg steps or idea on this topic for obvious reasons however if you are interested please message me and I&#39;ll send you the steps I have in mind. Thanks</p>
