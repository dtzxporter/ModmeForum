<p>Hi,<br />I want to attempt to import the giant robot from origins into my map but have very limited knowledge on Maya. I have extracted the models using Greyhound, but they all are separate from each other (head, torso, hip, shoulder, etc) and it seems as if I have to piece them together in Maya, but I don&#39;t know how to do it so that I can apply the xanims that I have also exported.</p>
