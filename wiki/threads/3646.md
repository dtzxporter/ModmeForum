<p>Hey everyone,<br />Just wondering if anyone is sharing completed cold war weapon ports?<br />I don&#39;t really feel like having to do it all myself if someone has already done it.<br />If anyone is willing to share their weapons it would be much appreciated,<br /><br />Thanks</p>

As well as some anims are bugged and sounds missing. Overall if these are you first ports you&#39;ve done a pretty good job. <br />btw are you gonna complete these weapons to include other weapons, (dlc, killstreaks, crossbow &amp; chinalake) ?</p>

I&#39;ve also been trying to find the m79 anims you aint alone. Also i&#39;m trying to export the minigun myself, however you need to do something special to export the anims otherwise you just get an error. I can send you the anims if you dont have them already.</p>
