<p>Thread By: Wild<br />Hey guys, I am trying to get lights to activate when power is turned on. I have used this tutorial: <iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zyOTvTvZ6Yk:301" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br /><br /><br />I end up getting a Clientfield  mismatch error Check host TTY output for client &amp; server clientfield registration details. <br /><br /><br /><br />I know this error is caused from the gsc and csc not being consistent or something like that, however I don&#39;t see anything wrong. I have followed the video exact and have re-done it like 3 times and I still get this error while trying to play the map. I was wondering if anyone could skim through this tutorial and tell me what&#39;s wrong with the tutorial or what&#39;s missing. If not then I&#39;d be okay with a link to a working tutorial on turning lights on with the power. Thankyou<br /><br /><br /><br /><em>//Mod edit: Embedded link.</em></p>
