<p>As per image, I have extracted the model for the Chaos Zombies Mystery Box.<br />However, I am having difficulty finding the correct animations for the box, as they are unnamed within Greyhound.<br />Does anyone have a link to the animations or box in general?</p>

<p>Not sure this will have it in it because I didn&#39;t really do much exporting from BO4 but I&#39;m pretty sure this was used to get the names of those unnamed assets in BO4: <a href="https://github.com/Scobalula/GreyhoundPackageIndex">https://github.com/Scobalula/GreyhoundPackageIndex</a><br /><br />Here&#39;s a link to some lists you ca scroll through too and see if the animations are there: <a href="https://github.com/Scobalula/GreyhoundPackageIndex/tree/master/PackageIndexSources/BO4">https://github.com/Scobalula/GreyhoundPackageIndex/tree/master/PackageIndexSources/BO4</a><br /><br />Hope that helps a little, If not I apologize like I said I didn&#39;t really ever export things from BO4 for this exact reason lol</p>
