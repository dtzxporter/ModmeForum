<p>Thread By: snprym<br /><p style="text-align:left;">I was trying out the alt-mode setting in APE but it works, when i press 4 i get the alt-weapon, but when the alt weapon is equiped the original gun is still available so it takes 2 weapon slots. Is there any way to fix this? I know this isnt the clearest explanation but i hope its understandable.</p></p>

<p>Reply By: Jdcobra<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Is the alt. weapon&#39;s inventory mode set to altmode? I know how weird alt. modes are to do, I just did one today and it was a pain</p></p>
