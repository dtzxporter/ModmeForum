<p>So I&#39;ve recently been adding updates to a map I&#39;ve been making but for some reason my player spawns in however you cannot see his hands nor weapon. Even if I purchase a weapon, perk, door or anything it all registers and I can shoot and stuff but my view handmodel is just completely invisible for some reason? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you :)</p>
