<p>Okay so I have 3 exploders here, and they&#39;re all classed as one exploder (in the exploder manager) so that when the exploder::exploder(&quot;explodername&quot;) is called in the script, it activates all of them. what would be the best way of stopping a specific exploder here, preferably without creating an exploder for each one as I want to be able to copy paste as many as I want without creating new exploders.<br /><br />Is there a way to link exploders to triggers? Maybe I could somehow do that and check the trigger.target? I&#39;m not sure but please let me know if you could help, cheers.<br /><br />

<br /></blockquote><br /><br />You&#39;ll need to set them all up as individual exploders, same as if you were exploding  a wall.</p>
