<p>Thread By: TrueGamerCalls<br />I used Wraith to export all of these.<br /> <br />I included both of the announcers, and instructions for which one you want to add.<br /> <br /><a href="https://mega.nz/#!QRM2kRDK!KtXhwzsSc2KME29wuXqc0ZB8wI1Qsp9U7Uo3oVW8Xjk">Download</a>  <br />Here is a video showcasing both them<br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GYDtoCLJfqU" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /> Quickly made this at 1:00am. Tired AF.<br /> <br />Credits:<br />Wraith -DTZxPorter<br />Announcer Sounds -TrueGamerCalls<br />Orignal Assets -Treyarch<br /> <br /> <br /><strong>EDIT: I HAVE NOTICED SEVERAL PEOPLE ADDING THIS AND NOT CREDITING ME, PLEASE CREDIT ME IF YOU USE MY ANNOUNCER PACK, THANK YOU.</strong></p>

<p>Reply By: Frost Iceforge<br />1. Isn&#39;t Samantha the default announcer in the BO3 tools? Unless these are the more demonic World at War quotes. If so, you should advertise this post as that.<br />2. You should have Richtofen&#39;s fire sale music with the Richtofen pack. <br />3. You should specify it as BO2 Richtofen and maybe add BO1 Richtofen as an option. You could Wraith them from BO3 Moon if you don&#39;t have BO1.</p>

<p>Reply By: BrandonTr3<br />This is pretty cool but this is like the third annoucner pack i downloaded and none worked. I followed the instructions and thought maybe theres a duplicate user aliases somewhere but there isnt. Not sure why it isnt working :/</p>
