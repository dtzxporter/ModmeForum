<p>Thread By: Jermz<br />I&#39;ve been working on my map for the past few weeks and everything worked perfectly during that time. However when the 5/23/17 update dropped for the Mod Tools, I get a &quot;cod2map64.exe has stopped working&quot; pop-up. I already know it has nothing to do with any of the assets on my map and this error is also showing up when I try to compile maps I&#39;ve published in the past that I haven&#39;t touched in months. Is anyone else experiencing this bug? Is it because of the new update? I was also planning on releasing this map today as well :^(.  Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Reply By: itznvy<br />This issue is a bug of the May 23 update. I hope they fix it soon. You can use a different launcher or use a backup of your old launcher. I use the MC launcher until this is fixed.</p>

<p>Reply By: soul-toktzt<br />I thought this was because of my steam said i had to install BO3, even though i had every file, installed it again, tried mod tools, found the compiler didn&#39;t work, validated the files.... xD</p>
