<p>Hi<br />So, I kinda ruined my map<br />Yesterday I add a Boss fight, some perks and audios, compile and all good. I could open the map but still have somethings missing<br /><br />So I change some things and now my map doesn&#39;t open, it just enter the black screen and then close the game<br /><br />Anyone know what could it be? I&#39;m really desperate and any help I really appreciated :(</p>
