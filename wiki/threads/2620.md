<p>^ this guy cant do shit<br /><br />as proven by not being able to install a simple script on his own video and pirating all OUR shit on his website<br /><br />( btw you muppet, it was as simple as adding the #using in the GSC, if you cant figure that out then id suggest you DONT offer to help people or record yourself fucking it up - and the reason there was no instructions is coz it wasnt released so you clearly got it from someone behind my back )<br /><br />stay well away from this scumbag</p>

<p>I&#39;d be happy to help. I&#39;m not the greatest mapper, but I&#39;d love to help you out on this. If you send me some pictures on what you have so far I can give you feedback on what you can add/fix. DM me on Discord if you want to. - <span style="color:rgb(247, 218, 100);">RllyyTwitchyy.gsc#6608</span></p>

You be you and i will be me. Let it go.<br /><br />There are lots of things i could say rn, but its not needed so..... lets move forewards?<br /><br />(Also this has nothing to do with the topic, if you want to talk or chat about this dm me to further discuss it)</p>

<p>you being you was ripping me off so no - fuck you<br /><br />( 2020 or at the end of 2019  ) - it definitely wasnt as all my links were down and i wasnt even IN THE COMMUNITY during that entire year ( and the dig sites were one of the first things i did when the tools came out 4 YEARS AGO ), ive only recently come back and any release i put up this year is still up now<br /><br />take your bullshit somewhere else coz everyone KNOWS THIS<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/c4d8fb6fa1fdca08aad10dc5d6ce3663.png"><br /><br />just to prove hes a lying piece of shit ^ look at the date<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/8407a06a11697e98f523aaee184610fd.png"><br /><br />^ and theres what the actual finished version looks like, not the dodgy one youve managed to swindle out of some asshole i personally gave it to<br /><br /><br />PS i suggest you take the rest of your shit down too, as not a SINGLE THING on your site is actually yours, and you dont have permission for ANY OF IT<br /><br />you cant even argue you are &quot;backing it up&quot; anyway, as you rehosted stuff i PURPOSEFULLY took down, and the rest of the shit youve got up is still VALID here, so you are literally trying to force traffic to you instead of here like the self serving asshole you are<br /><br />learn to actually do something yourself or fuck off - weve got one icegrenade thats enough, think i speak for everyone<br /><br />you are a complete thieving scumbag cock womble with absolutely 0 morals</p>
