<p>Thread By: Frost Iceforge<br />I was wondering if anyone could make a script for an area of the map where zombies would spawn infinitely and get +1 round&#39;s worth of health every couple seconds like on Moon. The increasing health is optional I suppose, but would make going to that area early rounds or making it the spawn too easy.</p>
