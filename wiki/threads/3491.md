<p>Hi<br />as you know extracted x-models does not faced to world axis in maya  . therefore the front of models does not aligned to Z axis . i wan to import models to game engines (unity) and if i rotate root of the rig (joint tag ) to face the skinned models to z axis then i will appear a problem in unity . the problem is rotation of imported models in transform component doesn&#39;t (0 , 0 , 0) for examples is (-90, 90 , 0) . <br />hence i want to orient rigged models to align to z axis in maya and then reset rotation to 0 , 0 , 0 .<br />HOW CAN FIX THIS ?</p>
