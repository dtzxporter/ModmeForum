<p>Thread By: zomboassasin<br />I have a hole in a ceiling in my map that i need zombies to spawn and go straight to. <br /><br />I have the nodes setup and it works when the zombies are just trying to find flesh but not that well and some of them end up getting stuck sometimes. <br /><br />so how can i have them go straight for it like they do a window?<br /><br />I tried changing the script_string but they just stand there. <br /><br />any thoughts?</p>
