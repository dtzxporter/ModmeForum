<p>Thread By: DorDur215<br /><p style="text-align:left;">I have ported plenty of weapons to BO3 including 3arc dual wields but I can&#39;t for the life of me figure out how to do the IW dual wields properly. What really bothers me is that NOT A SINGLE person in this modding community has ever made any tutorial on this as far as I know. I would really appreciate if someone could help me with this. And im pretty sure alot of other weapon porters are interested in this aswell.</p></p>
