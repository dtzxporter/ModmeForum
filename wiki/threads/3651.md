<p>I am constantly getting the following Radiant bugs:<br /><br />1) Random entities are no longer selectable <br /><br />2) Random entities in Radiant don&#39;t show up in-game<br /><br />3) Random entities don&#39;t show up in the Radiant editor (that were previously deleted) BUT SHOW UP IN-GAME<br /><br />4) The orientation (angles) of random entities is not consistent between the Radiant editor and in-game <br /><br />Is there any general rule of thumb to prevent these bugs from happening and keeping Radiant stable?<br /><br />If more detail is required, I&#39;ll be happy to provide.</p>
