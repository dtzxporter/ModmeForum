<p>I am trying to figure out a way to port models and animations from a old game called STALKER to the DAYZ game.<br />In my efforts I have come across this forum and would appreciate if someone can share a valid *.SEANIM file a test I will do.</p>

<p>Please contact [USER=36]@zeroy[/USER] he&#39;s pretty much gotten the conversion process down. It requires a few manual interventions due to the weird game setup.<br />We&#39;re hoping to get more tutorials for DayZATool soon.</p>
