<p>This is the script for the defense mode in Border Patrol: <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1834129541">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1834129541</a><br />Essentially a tower defense mode, the zombies are attracted to a point of interest and it is up to the players to act as the defenses. The script allows for extra hordes of zombies and higher health zombies to be spawned in normal rounds as well as in the final round and their health and time between spawns are controlled separately. You choose what round is the final round and how many zombies are allowed to cross before the game ends. It is setup so that multiple triggers can be used to count the zombies to give some creative freedom on the amount of paths you want the zombies to be able to take to get to the point of interest.<br /><br />Download: <a href="https://mega.nz/file/YdRygbTK#i2TqVtdnXmQ374F3IZMBQdCJnSjmtKCNNxSTaOUKqQ4">https://mega.nz/file/YdRygbTK#i2TqVtdnXmQ374F3IZMBQdCJnSjmtKCNNxSTaOUKqQ4</a><br /><br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hp-5evvglpY" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Dv5ZK2SzuE" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
