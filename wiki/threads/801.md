<p>Thread By: RainbowBanana26<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Hey everyone im currently trying to build a map much like IW&#39;s extinction gamemode in Ghosts. I would like to have no zombies spawn at all, then have them start spawning quickly for x amount of minutes when i activate a trigger (for example, pressing [use] to starting a generator). After the time is up, they stop spawning and wont spawn again until another trigger is activated (example: another generator). Would this be possible to script into my map? Thank you so much in advance for the help.</p></p>
