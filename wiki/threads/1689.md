<p>Reply By: LegacyNm<br />This could be a few things. <br />First, when importing your seanim file, tag_weapon needs to be named j_gun. When exporting then it should be changed to tag_weapon. <br />Second, the culprit could be your animation file for the weapon. If that isn&#39;t set up correctly it screws up the whole gun and makes it look strange.</p>

If it wasn&#39;t, the animation would already look broken in Maya. The anims look fine in Maya, however. <br /> <br />It&#39;s odd because I&#39;ve ported several other weapons exactly the same and they all look fine.<br /> <br />I&#39;ll re-rip and re-export the animations in case something has gone wrong there.</p>

Weapon in picture is the MTAR-X. Also happened with BO3 M14, but that could be another issue since it was my first attempt at porting a weapon from BO3.</p>

Used a set of viewhands from BO3.<br /> <br />Anyways, I did some testing with some publically released weapons (there are a lot of mtar-x ports here) and it seems that my issue is caused by a faulty anim_model. When I replaced mine with a downloaded one, the anims started working normally.<br /> <br />Thanks for the help everyone</p>
