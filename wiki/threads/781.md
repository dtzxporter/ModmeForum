<p>Thread By: XxCAFxX<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Hello, first i want to state that i am aware that there are youtube videos on how to do this, but the problem is my internet got shut off and im using my phones hotspot which got capped after 3gb -.- so im stuck with 2g speeds making youtube impossible to watch. But anyways im trying to figure out what i would need to do in order to make a trigger that triggers a sound when I walk through it. I have the sound alies prepped and my audio fil is the proper format and whatnot i just dont know how to trigger it.</p></p>

On a side note im using your ambient sound and brutus scripts and they&#39;re simply amazing thank you for all your hard work!</p></p>

Trig = getEnt("flesh_fire_trig", "targetname");

{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p>{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
Trig waittill("trigger", action);

{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p>{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
action playsound("flesh_fire");

{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br /></p><p style="text-align:left;">{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
But now the problem is that it only plays once and its audible from other players. 

{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br /></p></p>

<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br /><p style="text-align:left;">You can simply place the code you have made in a while(1) loop like so: </p>{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
while(1)
{
	//code you made goes here to happen over and over
}

{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br /><br /><br /><p style="text-align:left;">as far as being heard by all players, it sounds like you have made the sound 2d in your sound alias. It should be 3d. Replace that specific instance of 2d to 3d in user_aliases.csv</p></p>
