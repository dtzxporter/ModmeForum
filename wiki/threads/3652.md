<p>Heya, first time posting here so apologies for any formatting mistakes. <br /><br />I&#39;ve recently been developing a map and haven&#39;t had many issues with crashes, but recently I cannot load into my map at all. Not sure if something I&#39;ve added is breaking it, but it compiles and links with no errors in the editor. However as soon as I try to run it in game or through the editor, the game closes with no error message at the black screen. I&#39;ve already tried reverting some of the thing I changed since it last ran, however at this point I&#39;m removing things that were working in my map prior to the latest changes. I&#39;m really lost here and would appreciate any help. Thanks.</p>

<p>Whenever i have this problem it&#39;s because there is a wallbuy for a weapon that&#39;s not added / added properly. So maybe start by removing all wallbuys and misc stuff like that.</p>
