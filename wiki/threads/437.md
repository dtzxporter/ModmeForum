<p>Thread By: Azazel<br />I was wondering if i could do this? well i know we could, but my question would be how? Would it be the same as say, dogs? <br /> <br />where you have a script model and a script struct?</p>

<p>Reply By: Wild<br />No, you would need to get the models and animations set up and script the entire thing yourself.</p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br /> Like AGC said, you would need to create the margwa and spiders yourself. Margwas would spawn like NSZ Brutus or my Panzer soldat and spiders would spawn like dogs. Maybe I&#39;ll get around to making the spiders this month.</p>

I haven&#39;t looked for them or anything but maybe you can find them and experiment with that. It would save you from the scripting part lol</p>
