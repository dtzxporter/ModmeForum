<p>Thread By: Dcchill<br />Hey guys,<br /><br />So I was wondering if it was possible to get weapons from campaign.  For example, I would like to put this on a wall buy, <a href="http://callofduty.wikia.com/wiki/Micro-Missile_Launcher">http://callofduty.wikia.com/wiki/Micro-Missile_Launcher</a><br /><br />So would I need to import it using Wraith? Or can someone help me find them in the game files?  <br /><br />Thank you for helping a noob like me!</p>
