<p>These prefabs probably be useless to most people but hey ho, I don&#39;t care, as long as it helps someone with mapping.<br /><br />Have you ever found some models that require additional models to complete it&#39;s whole? For me, that creates headache, so this is a little pack that does this all for you, with FXes &amp; Clips (Monster, Player &amp; Physics). Some of these prefabs might have <em>lensflare</em> FX, if you don&#39;t like it, enter the prefab and remove it.<br /><br />I might take requests but I cannot guarantee they&#39;ll be done.<br /><br />Here&#39;s what are currently in this tiny pack (recommended only for dark maps):<br /><blockquote><span style="font-size:1.7em;">candle_chandlier (No clip)</span><br />[IMG width=&quot;353px&quot;]https://i.gyazo.com/1df805608657b523050666e0211abed4.jpg[/IMG]</blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote><span style="font-size:1.7em;">p7_candle_03_orange + fx + clip</span><br />[IMG width=&quot;277px&quot;]https://i.gyazo.com/f00187021407dc38ee1f7b7b1bb420a4.jpg[/IMG]</blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote><span style="font-size:1.7em;">p7_inf_foy_candle_holder + candles + fx + clip + lensflare</span><br />[IMG width=&quot;182px&quot;]https://i.gyazo.com/9a2e92f2ab8f5efdd6e41cf10aa8b641.png[/IMG]</blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote><span style="font-size:1.7em;">p7_inf_foy_candle_holder_sconce + candles + fx + lensflare</span><br />[IMG width=&quot;308px&quot;]https://i.gyazo.com/2b56d0d575e58d1db7ad7a3eebe3a852.jpg[/IMG]</blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote><span style="font-size:1.7em;">p7_barrel_metal_55gal_green_drk + fx + clip</span><br />[IMG width=&quot;216px&quot;]https://i.gyazo.com/230e16a03099f80636d4f57cd725dc1b.gif[/IMG]<br />(Disclaimer: That yellow crystal for staff is not in the prefab &#128541;)<br /></blockquote><br /><br />There might be more to come if I come across any other annoying models that requires additional models to complete as a whole. But drop any requests below, I&#39;ll see if I can do it.<br />I haven&#39;t centred all the prefabs, might do at later time. So if you drop these prefabs into the map, they&#39;ll pop up elsewhere in your map.<br /><br />

<br /><br />Not necessary, but I would appreciate anyone using the prefabs to credit me just to motivate me in getting stuff like these publicly released and done.</p>
