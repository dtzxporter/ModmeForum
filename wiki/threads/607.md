<p>Thread By: Jacobsmob<br />I&#39;m wondering if you are able to acquire a weapon and change its damage/reload time/speed inside the script. I&#39;ve been trying to get the players knife(still don&#39;t know how) and change its damage for when certain things are met. I&#39;ve tried to get the weapon then do weapon.damage or weapon[damage] but those work. Been searching for a while on wikis and forums but found nothing about how to do it.<br /><br /><br /><br />I&#39;ve seen it done before I think, with crusaders ail, but that could easily just be changing the weapon.<br /><br /><br /><br />One more thing, how do you use: GetCurrentWeaponIncludingMelee();<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks for the help.<br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT: Found out the weapon.damage and all that is read only so never mind. Kinda sucks but oh well.</p>
