<p>Reply By: Tjmoney030589<br />The Xbox controller worked until I downloaded BO2,  so I was wondering if I had to change a setting or something along that line... The problem with the textures is all the blend textures are gone in radiant I ported over a cannon barrel for my new map and I deleted a file called Lambert 1 out of APE. I thought it was just for the barrel and I guess I was wrong lol (no surprise) Soooo can this be fixed??? Thanks for the help :)</p>
