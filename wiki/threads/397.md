<p>Thread By: Symbo<br /><br /><br /><br />I tried to solve this issue on my own for a week now but can&#39;t find anything: I can&#39;t blend texture anymore.<br /><br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I think the problem is here for a mount or two but I wasn&#39;t mapping at the time. I select the right axes, alpha, flatten then alt+right click or left and nothing happend. Allow sotf selection on unselected patches is check and it works if I select noise or smooth. I tried to reset default preferences, verify cache in steam, reinstall the mod tool.. nothing worked. Any suggestion? I am gonna give up mapping if I can&#39;t blend<br /> <br />Edit: I finally solved the issue by nuke the registry</p>
