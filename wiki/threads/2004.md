<p>Thread By: iAr7uRo<br />Hello friends, a few days ago I reinstalled the windows so I deleted and cleaned my junk hard drive. Everything went well I made the backup of my files and also a backup of the obtained assets textures, models, weapons, etc ...<br /> <br />I also made a backup of the map I was doing, but just copy the folder with the extension: usermaps / zm_motel. It contains the folders: scripts, sound, zone and zone_sourse. I thought that just by moving the zm_motel folder again I could edit the map normally as I did before.<br />I downloaded a program that recovers lost files after I had formatted the computer and found several files that have the extension of my zm_map map. But I do not know what files are necessary to recover my map and be able to open it in Radiant.<br /> <br />I only know that there is a very important file to be able to execute the map that is zm_motel.map. But that file can not be found in the search the program did. Could anyone help me please?<br />I add that if I move the zm_motel folder to user maps, if I can run it in the Black Ops 3 game, everything will be intact.<br /> <br />I hope your help thanks and excuse my English!<br /> <br />Image only have this file.<br /><a href="https://ibb.co/iyXftG">https://ibb.co/iyXftG</a></p>

So it should be zm_yourmap.map</p>

I get several zm_motel.map files and I do not understand why, since I tried to download one and put it in the folder: map_sourse / zm and nothing happened when starting in radiant the same error comes out.   Here are some images of what can be recovered with the program.   <iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MXegxOK" frameborder="0"></iframe>   <iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QCcETri" frameborder="0"></iframe></blockquote><br /> Those .map files are all autosaves from Radiant. Make sure you remove the numbers from the file name. Also when you say &quot;nothing happened when starting in Radiant&quot; does that mean you&#39;re trying to open the map from the launcher? If so, try just opening Radiant, then go to file/open and see if you can open it that way. If it works like that then you need to make sure you remove the numbers from the file name so it matches what your map name is in the launcher.</p>
