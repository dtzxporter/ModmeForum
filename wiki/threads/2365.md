<p>Thread By: Madgaz182<br /> <br />Many have asked me about my custom perks and when ill release them, this first release will contain my custom AMMO MATIC perk machine, this is the cut perk from DER RIESE , i based the model off an old candy machine and used the hidden texture from der riese as a bases for it.. enjoy and credit when you use it thank you.<br /><br />Now many of you will have seen the STAMINUP MODEL RESKINNED, this is not that.<br />What this Perk machine essentially does is gives the players a max ammo refill to your ammunitions<br />you can tweak the script to make the price of the machine cost what ever you desire<br /><br />**note** i havent fully set up the sounds, as of now the machine just uses the MAX AMMO announcement sound bite when using the machine, if you wanna change it just look for (PLAYSOUN) in the script and change to you desired sound<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/dvteT7T.png"><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://imgur.com/dvteT7T">The machine comes with lights set up to use exploders, read the README file to see how to install those correctly<br />The script for the max ammo part was created by natesmith<br /> <br /><a href="https://mega.nz/#!kDBTnLQK!trAuUxCtaJWjaDIUAJXHtriwSc6MT8Wn-ng6ZB_d41w">Download</a></p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />selling yourself a little short here with this post, you should make it look nicer, to reflect the (I assume) good quality of what you&#39;re releasing. You should put some pictures up, or maybe a description of what exactly the perk does (I&#39;m sure there are plenty of people who don&#39;t know what Ammo-matic is).<br /> <br />Also you should put who to credit in the post too. I assume you did most of the work since I know you model, and create perk jingles but did you also do the scripting?<br /> <br />Obviously you don&#39;t have to do any of this, but it can help avoid endless comments saying &quot;what is this?&quot;, &quot;what does the perk do?&quot;, or &quot;who do I credit?&quot;.</p>
