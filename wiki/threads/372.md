<p>Thread By: Ahmed02354<br />So as you may know if you do a &#39;&#39;terrain patch there are all these purple and green squares. ut how do I make a hole in this terrain patch, because I want to make an underground tunnel but do I have to make 2 terrains then? or can I make a hole in the first one if you know what I mean</p>

When you press V, you can move some points around too.</p>
