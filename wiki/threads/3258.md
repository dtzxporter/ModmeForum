<p>I am experiencing a very annoying issue regarding lighting. The walls of my room have strange irregular splotches of light on them for some reason. I suspect it is reflection probe issues but I&#39;m not too sure. Any help on the matter is appreciated. <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.739.png' | relative_url }}"></p>

<p>not sure but here are a few things you can try<br /><br />-remove old and place a new probe<br />-make sure the edges are inside the wall<br />-make sure the wall is thick enough<br />-change sun split distance in your sun volume to something lower<br />-try to change light quality to high and then build lights to see if it&#39;s still there</p>
