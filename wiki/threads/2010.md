<p>Thread By: modric<br />I downloaded Snypryms melee weapons and they work great except they dont have sounds. I would love to add some sort of melee sound, even the default knifing one would work. Also is it possible to make his melee weapons into a bowie knife type weapon? <br /> <br />Here is his post: <a href="https://aviacreations.com/modme/index.php?view=topic&tid=1282&page=2">https://aviacreations.com/modme/index.php?view=topic&amp;tid=1282&amp;page=2</a></p>

I&#39;ll send it to you in PMs.<br /> <br />As for setting it up as an offhand melee, you need to create a meleeweapon file in APE and transfer animations, models, damage values etc from Synprym&#39;s bulletweapon file into this file and then reference it in your zone file. If you&#39;re unsure how to do this, I recommend you get Discord (unless you already have it), and ask within the various Mod Tools servers created by the community for help. It&#39;s easier to guide you with instant messaging.<br /> <br />Within the GDT is a sharedweaponsounds asset along with fx, follow the various other files referenced by these to locate where the aliases are defined so you can set them up yourself, then reference the sharedweaponsounds asset in your bulletweapon file. FX is optional, although I recommend it to increase the quality of the port.<br /> <br />Hopefully I&#39;ve helped.</p>
