<p>Im making a shootable easter egg and used this script (<a href="https://pastebin.com/iru9hwX8">https://pastebin.com/iru9hwX8</a>) from Ice grenade, and was wondering how I could add a specific sound to play directly after the model is shot? I tried using the code &quot;player playsound(&quot;audioid&quot;); &quot; but it doesnt seem to work, any suggestions?</p>

<p>It worked great! Thanks a lot, by the way would you happen to know how to install perk shaders? I&#39;ve resized them all to 64x64 in ape, named them all correctly in my zone file,but only double tap and mule kick register as the custom perk shaders, while the rest just still seem to use the stock shaders? Only if you know how</p>
