<p>Thread By: XxCAFxX<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Hello, I was wondering if anyone could script me a small custom perk, just like the tittle says i want a perk that makes the player immune to trigger hurt damage. basically my map has a bunch of bo2 style lava and i think it would be a great idea. when i upload the map all credit would go to the scripter. </p></p>

There is no direct way to set an immunity to a trigger_damage. I can script it if someone models the machine. I hate making a perk without a nice machine. </p></p>

<p>Reply By: mapmaker12<br />Hello. I know this about 2 years late but I decided to give it a shot. I was wondering if any of you had the completed project and if they could share it with the community. It would mean a lot and be a great addition to my map. Thanks.</p>
