<p>Thread By: XxRaPiDK3LLERxX<br />I wanted to try to create a custom perk. haven&#39;t figured out a name yet, but have found what the function would be. (I would also appreciate if someone can give a video link to model texture editing for a perk machine) I would also like to use this perk as well as wardog&#39;s perks without any nasty conflicts or any compatibility issues.<br /> <br />Function:<br />Once obtained, player would receive 10% extra maximum ammo, IF ammo is above 900 (that&#39;s an IF), then increase maximum ammo loaded capacity by 10%<br /> <br />I&#39;m making this perk for my Nightmare Bar map that is releasing in a month time.<br /> <br />Any help would be appreciated!<br /> <br />EDIT: I have figured out a name: Cowboy&#39;s Belt</p>

Probably 25% is sufficient...<br />But I don&#39;t know how to make perk machines, texture it &amp; script it :|</p>

<p>Reply By: XxRaPiDK3LLERxX<br />I&#39;ve added the scripts for the perks, can someone check them if they are right? I&#39;m going to use stock mule kick vending machine for this perk as I have no experience at texturing a model.<br /><a href="https://mega.nz/#!EtxzXYbY!oOohq_hgn0yNuxMpb90pK_FcJh2TEFyzaJYL2f0TdXI">Download</a>Thanks!</p>
