<p>Thread By: MrTombone8<br />I have done alot of weapon porting and maya work for a long time and after I wiped windows on the 24th to install my new ssd&#39;s I reinstalled the mod tools and started to recreate some weapons which I have made before starting off with WAW&#39;s PTRS.<br />Here&#39;s a video of the PTRS that I created before the PC Reset<br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zgcouwSyoos" frameborder="0"></iframe><br />I done as I did before using Scobalula&#39;s One click does plenty but when i finally got into game the animation were fucked, I reconverted the anims, the anim model, the viewmodel and then i saw an error which was a duplicate bone so i used a different RIG and that error disappeared and the messed up anim changed to a different messed up anim heres a pic<br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SV5Kc0T" frameborder="0"></iframe><br />The hands are in the correct location and move but the viewmodel is in a completely different place. The joints move and i cant find a reason to why its like that.<br /> <br />Update<br />I refollowed jbird tut and used the bo2 an94 and followed it all though and the same thing happened.</p>
