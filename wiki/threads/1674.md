<p>Thread By: tygo246<br />I am trying to get a weed plant in my map. I downloaded some 3d models online but i&#39;m struggling to get the textures into maya. I also tried wraith on a custom map called &quot;ganja farm&quot; but the exports didn&#39;t include any texture images. Any can help me with the custom model?</p>
