<p>Thread By: Collie<br />Hi all, apologies for the delay, but it&#39;s finally here! My COD World War 2 conversion rig.<br /> <br />Instructions on use are the same as all my other conversion rigs, minus doing anything with namespaces (It&#39;s not necessary for the anims to work properly this time). If you need instructions on use please refer to this post <a href="http://aviacreations.com/modme/index.php?view=topic&tid=1375">here</a>.<br /> <br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DxaXAazoVnx7G8q5ncFgRT-LsPQUlzNL">Download</a> <br /> <br />I&#39;d like to give a huge thank you to DTZxPorter for the support he has shown my rigs. Without him, these rigs wouldn&#39;t have been possible. <br /> <br />I&#39;d also like to give credit and thanks to Azsry for giving me a baseline to create my own conversion rig way back when I had no idea what I was doing.<br /> <br />As always, if there are any errors in the post, the rig, or the shelf please feel free to let me know.</p>

ADS anims only animates 1 joint, so that looks normal.</p>

<p>Reply By: The Black Death<br /><blockquote><em>coolrooman</em><br />Is anyone else having problems with the fire animations?</blockquote><br /> I assume your issue is it being a different position on the last frame versus the first. You need to merge the fire (but not fire_ads) and settle animations, tutorials are available on YouTube.</p>
