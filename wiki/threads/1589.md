<p>Thread By: VertexeCelery<br />Just to see what an animation actually looks like full body and everything, how would I attach the head model to the body model in Maya?? (Sorry, a bit of a noob)<br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT 2:<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://s27.postimg.org/6jraenyur/Lol.png"> <br /><br /><br /><br />Okay, well I did it, however, I&#39;m not sure if I did it correctly. I simply renamed the head joints to the joints of spine4, and the body spine4 to something like neck21. (As you can see, spine41 is the joint of the head model, If you were to expand spine4, it would show the renamed neck and head joints (e.g. neck21)) This works, however is there a better way of doing it???</p>
