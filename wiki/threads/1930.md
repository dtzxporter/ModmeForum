<p>Thread By: Sinic<br />So i have a problem after this tutorial, my player character is not set to ruin, i am just a bloodhound gun on the ground. <br /> <br />UPDATE: i&#39;ve gotten the viewhands fully working thanks to The Indestructible Mike Pence, now i just need help with the full body model</p>
