<p>Thread By: WARDOGSK93<br />Converting all assets now rather than later whats the use of it?<br /><br /><br /><br />I guess major thing would be when you use a new texture, model or anything in your map it wont need to be converted and compile time wouldnt be as long<br /><br /><br /><br />To do this download this <a href="https://mega.nz/#!7cJGBRCJ!z4jUXrzYFcng40eaZC6LMoMHMAFrIikC8B86psPM2tc">file</a> and put it in your Black Ops 3 bin folder &quot;root/bin&quot; or you can create a .bat file in the same folder with this code<br /><br /><br /><br />Once the bat file is in your bin folder just double click it and let it do its thing<br /><br /><br /><br />
{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
@echo off
cls

call linker_modtools.exe -language english -convertall -verbose

{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Just a quick FYI when you do this it might a take while cause there alot of assets in Black Ops 3 to convert, I would reccomend doing this overnight or when your not using your pc</p>
