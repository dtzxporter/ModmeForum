<p>Thread By: OK_MATE<br />So this issue has been annoying me for a while now I thought it&#39;s be a good idea to see if someone here knows how to sort it. <br /> <br />Whenever I drag Azsry&#39;s setupArmRig.mel, or the newer one (setupArmRig_h1.mel), the wrists on the idle animation get bejaysused to fuck. I&#39;m using Collie&#39;s latest version of the conversion rig, mind you this still happened with the older version too, and I have tested this with multiple models and animations. It doesn&#39;t seem to matter what game they&#39;re from either (IW/Treyarch).  <br /> <br />This is what it looks like:<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/hYRHmfH.png"><br /> <br />Sometimes only one of the wrists get messed up, with the other being less than usual. I think I&#39;ve got the animation rig on once without any distortion but I have no idea what I did. Maybe there&#39;s a fix for this or a better kit that does the same thing. <br /> <br />I would greatly appreciate any ideas on how to sort this, it&#39;s just really frustrating and I&#39;d love to just get animating like.</p>

<p>Reply By: Collie<br />It&#39;s because the wrists are rotated to really high negative/positive values. Since wrist-twist for the whole arm is based off of what the X-axis rotational value is for the wrist, just rotate the wrist closer to zero until the wrist twist un-fucks itself. You may want to constrain the wrist to something so that the fingers positions are not affected.</p>

How to I set up the constraint to stop them doing that? Sorry, I&#39;m not that familiar with this type of maya stuff.</p>
