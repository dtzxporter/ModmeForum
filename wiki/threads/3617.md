<p>Hey all, I&#39;m having YET ANOTHER issue with my map. This time its a Blockers.gsc issue. I literally have never had this problem before. If anybody can help me on this I&#39;d appreciate it a ton.<br />The error only came up after I moved the map over to a new file (I was having issues with it before, figured it was script related, moved it to a new map which started out as Wild&#39;s Advanced ZM template and then I added back all the scripts and such that I had before that I know for a fact worked) and got to work, I guess something else got messed up in the process. None of my doors had given me ANY problems before I moved the map over and I haven&#39;t changed a thing involving them, so I genuinely have no clue what could be causing the issue.<br /><br /><br />The error:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}

With this issue specifically I&#39;m actually not sure what else I should include here, so whatever else I need to post, let me know and I&#39;ll provide it. Thanks in advance for any help I can get!</p>
