<p>Hi all, I recently downloaded the Zombies in Spaceland models (thank you, Zynx) to use in a custom map. Everything looks great in both Radiant and APE, but after loading into the game the textures behave strangely. On most of the models, the textures become halved or quartered. I think it&#39;s a lighting issue, but I can&#39;t really figure it out on my own. Any input is appreciated. <br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.867.png' | relative_url }}"></p>
