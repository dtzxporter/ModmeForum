<p>Reply By: tbone-5<br /><p style="text-align:left;">very nice job on this, just one thing you might want to fix for people. for the idle hands anim you either forgot a model in the download, or your GDT is just set wrong in the download it was set to a model that does not exist so idle hands did not work. i set it to the model the other anim was using &amp; it works fine just a heads up, it caused a glitchy mess for idle anim without fixing it</p></p>

I feel the same way.</p><p style="text-align:left;">When Treyarch made a video about zombies easter eggs a little while back, they talked about how originally, the end goal of zombies was to die. They showed scenes of the player dying with this animation in Mob Origins and Die Rise, but didn&#39;t show any deaths in BO3 maps.</p><p style="text-align:left;">You could tell Treyarch really liked this animation cinematically, so why did they remove it? I was genuinely pissed when I bought Black Ops III at launch, played a game of Shadows, died, and didn&#39;t see this aniamtion. </p><p style="text-align:left;"></p></p>

<p>Reply By: ZeRoY<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Note that I would stay away from using spaces in the folder names, can lead to problems down the line, I personally always use a _ </p></p>

<p>Reply By: BuIlDaLiBlE<br />The animation is playing two times faster than it originally did, I saw this in almost all WaW maps where this was implemented. I then did the same thing myself:<br /><br />

<br /><br />Could you maybe slow it down?</p>

In APE find &quot;bo2_deathhands&quot; and find these.<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/l5xws9q.png"><br /> <br />Adjust the numbers to your liking.</p>
