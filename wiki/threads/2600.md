I know HarryBO21 managed to use some of the compiled scripts in his Nova Crawlers, so it&#39;s entirely possible to make them work w/o having the raw script.</p>

I have no clue when it comes to this scripting malarkey so maybe i&#39;d have to contact someone about that. Also what is hydrax? and what could i use to port the assets (ik sounds i can use wraith but thats all I know)</p>

<p>To use a compiled script, you just need the ripped script, and <a href="https://wiki.modme.co/wiki/black_ops_3/Lua-(LUI).html">L3akMod</a>. In the zone, you would add {% highlight php %}{% raw %}
scriptparsetree,scripts/whater.gscc/cscc
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
to mark it as precompiled.</p>
