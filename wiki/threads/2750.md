<p>So for the past few days I have struggled export the billiards table model from Dead of the Night. I would appreciate if someone could export it for me since I kinda suck at it xD</p>

<p>The problem is now that I can&#39;t even run Black ops 4, you know, because it&#39;s such a well optimized game -.-</p>
