<p>Thread By: XxBREADxX<br />So basically I&#39;m Porting Weapons from Infinite Warfare and Modern Warfare Remastered for my Black Ops 3 zombies map. I&#39;m having trouble for getting the weapons sound. How can I get the proper weapons sound? <br /> <br />Sample : <br /> <br />ak47_fire<br />ak47_mag_out<br />ak47_mag_in<br />ak47_bolt_back<br />ak47_bolt_forward<br /> <br />Does anyone know how to get that?</p>

It&#39;s a guessing game for MWR.</p>

<p>Reply By: Slayerbeast12<br />Check soundfile1.pak with Wraith, most of the weapon foleys sounds are from soundfile1_unk4078 to soundfile1_unk4207<br /> <br />Ak47 boltpull and forward - soundfile1_unk4078<br />Ak47 magin - soundfile1_unk4079<br />Ak47 magout - soundfile1_unk4080<br /> <br />I don&#39;t know about the ak47 firesound since it seems that it uses multiple sounds I believe. But the firesounds for the weapons might be around  soundfile1_unk5090 or higher.</p>
