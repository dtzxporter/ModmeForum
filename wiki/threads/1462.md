<p>Thread By: m1cke<br />So when i port a weapon evry anim works except ads_fire when i ads and shot the sight disappears until i stop shoting then it goes back normal think the problem is caused by something i did wrong in maya</p>

<p>Reply By: Hero115<br />I will try to make it simple &amp; clear : <br /><br /><br /><br />IW Weapon (all normal anims) = tag_ads + tag_cambone (Hierarchy)<br /><br />IW Weapon (Ads anims &quot;ADS UP &amp; DOWN&quot; only) = tag_view + tag_ads <br /><br /><br /><br />3ARC Weapon (all normal anims) = tag_torso + tag_cambone (Hierarchy)<br /><br />3ARC Weapon (Ads anims &quot;ADS UP &amp; DOWN&quot; only) = tag_view + tag_torso <br /><br /><br /><br />That&#39;s the right joints, select them and you should be good.</p>

From what I assumed, and that worked for him/her; You know how Snipers overlay an image when scoped in?`The same thing is possibly happening to your gun, only you didn&#39;t enter any image for it to overlay. Try looking into something related to this.<br /><br />Also, what tutorial did you follow? Curious if the creator messed up.</p>

<p>Reply By: elricos<br />Export it like a normal anim, select hichery in tag_view and export :p .... if the problem stay again, maybe are the ads up/down, so check if you only export tag_torso (in case of treyarch) and tag_ads only (in case of iw)</p>
