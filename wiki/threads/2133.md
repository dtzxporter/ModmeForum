<p>Thread By: Dedrix<br />So basically when I load up my map after compiling it crashes about 20 seconds into launching the game.<br />It&#39;s similar to the crash if you were to have a &quot;false&quot; wallbuy, therefore I&#39;ve tried removing; the box, wallbuys,<br />pap, perk machines, zones, teleports, brutus spawns &amp; scripting, ect. and yet it continues to crash <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="//modme.co/emoticons/angry.png">.<br />(Could this be related to a script I possibly have overlooked?)<br />I&#39;m starting to get pretty annoyed with this one so if anyone has any ideas as to what might be going on I&#39;d really appreciate it,<br />Thanks <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="//modme.co/emoticons/pouty.png"></p>

<p>Reply By: peterparker<br />This is where I start:<br /> <br />On the Mod Tools Launcher, select your (compiled) map you are about to run, and then click the Dvars button. In the window that pops up, go to the &#39;logfile&#39; Dvar and change it&#39;s Value to &#39;1&#39; and click OK to save the value change. Right-click on your map and chose &quot;run map&quot; as you normally would.<br /> <br />After the map fails to launch, check your BO3 Root folder for a file called &quot;console_mp.log&quot;. Open that with your preferred text editor.<br /> <br />Please note:<br />1) You must open &#39;Dvars&#39; and click &#39;OK&#39; every time you go to run the map in order to get the log file, and I believe it will over-write the file when it runs. Personally, I move it to the desktop for safety till I track down any errors that need attention.<br /> <br />2) Don&#39;t panic at the amount of &quot;redundant&quot; and &quot;could not find&quot; errors. Slowly sort through to find anything that resembles the edits you made. I may be able to help walk you through some troubleshooting steps from there if you can&#39;t find the path.<br /> <br />Did that help?</p>

<p>Reply By: peterparker<br />Lets stick with the original problem, if we can. Do you still have the map that was failing<br />to load? If so, run it with the launcher and logfile enabled and post it to pastebin or under<br />a spoiler tag as above, as they can get very long. Then we can take a look together.<br /> <br /><blockquote>I&#39;m not exactly sure what to looking for here?<br /></blockquote><br /> <br />The problem will be related to any edits you have made, yes? If that is the case, you<br />need to look for anything that is related to the edits that you made prior to the<br />problem occurring.<br /> <br />Let&#39;s start there.</p>

<p>Reply By: peterparker<br />I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t be much more help. The log tells us that the load ends with asset<br />&quot;pb_pistol_dw_endgame_1stplace_idle&quot; hanging. You might check to see if that leads<br />anywhere, but you may end up chasing a phantom.<br /> <br />Perhaps try a new map from template, just to make sure the core stuff is ok. Again,<br />this is a longshot. It could be virtually anything.<br /> <br />If anyone else has any ideas, now is the time...</p>

<p>Reply By: Dedrix<br />So I&#39;ve just tried making a brand new map with 0 custom stuff and it still crashes all the same. Yikes<br />Also I have already tried &quot;verifying my game integrity&quot; and it changes nothing.<br /> <br />Please tell me I don&#39;t have to reinstall the game/mod tools!<img style="max-width: 500px;" src="//modme.co/emoticons/pinch.png"></p>

<p>Reply By: Dedrix<br />Uh update... <br />Like a dumbass I was only verifying the game rather than the modtools, mainly because I thought it would be doing both.<br />...and the game launched!! However my main map was still broken so I caved and just decided to delete a small majority of the map and it works again.<br />Thanks for the help guys<img style="max-width: 500px;" src="//modme.co/emoticons/smile.png"></p>
