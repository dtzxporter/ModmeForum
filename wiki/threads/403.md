<p>Thread By: Dextro62<br />Hi, so i get this weird lighting in this corridor in my map, I also get it in other places in my map but not as bad as this. If i add a window in the ceiling to let more light in I don&#39;t get this problem anymore, but does anyone know how to fix this without needing to add a window or any other source of light.<br /> <br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a/hDge6" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /> <br /> <br />Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Reply By: Dextro62<br />Yes i&#39;ve tried this aswell but it didn&#39;t change anything. I found that if i lower the reflection probe so that it is not touching the roof, and build the lights, I don&#39;t get the problem anymore, but the area below the roof will not be lit proberly. If i then add another reflection probe to the area below the roof I go back to having the original problem.</p>
