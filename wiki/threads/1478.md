<p>Thread By: Dcchill<br />So I finally am almost finished importing the scar-h, but one more problem I have is that the clip is not showing up!  Can you help me?  The Submodel&#39;s parent tag is j_gun if that helps.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Edit:Also, is anyone working on a custom weapon pack-a-punch tutorial?</p>
