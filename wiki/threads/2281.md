Just wondering.</p>

<p>I have a model of kratos&#39;s Leviathan Axe can I use a gdt like the one for the hatchet and just copy my model in or do I need to bind it to a rig and make animations for it can I just use the hell&#39;s retriever or hatchet animations I have. Will upload screen shot. Its still in .obj I will xport xmodel and import to APE. The Model is not mine but I did Edit and replace the UVs with textures<img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.386.jpg' | relative_url }}"> I made in Quixle and photoshop. Im also working on the First Blade but the model I was using was no good mesh had to many errors so Im redesigning it from scratch. I&#39;m new to modding I can Make Models, texures, and import them into my map but that is it I start to get a little lost with weapons. This is who model the axe: 29-leviathan_axe_pack_by_elite_gamerdownloaded it from turbosquid or one of those sites for free. no credit info in the download.</p>
