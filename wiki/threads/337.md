<p>Thread By: Wild<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Hey, I just started working on a new map along with my current map. My current map is mostly in a building so when I used reflection probes I just line it up with my walls and such like normal. My new map takes place 100% in the wilderness and I don&#39;t exactly know how to go about using reflection probes in this map. From what I understand about probes you usually line them up with walls and floors and stuff so I have no idea how to do it outside in an area for example, a forest. For all I know you just cover each area with a probe and that&#39;s it, I really have no idea. Any help is greatly appreciated. If what I said is confusing just let me know and I&#39;ll try and explain it differently. Thank you!</p></p>
