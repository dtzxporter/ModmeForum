<p>Hey so I am trying to export animations from cold war with greyhound but when I do I only get a animation &quot;file&quot; not actually a xanim file, my anim settings in greyhound are set to export for mod tools - xanim, but all I get is the anim but its a &quot;file&quot; -does anyone know how to fix this or what to do.<br /><br />I attached pictures to show what I mean.</p>
