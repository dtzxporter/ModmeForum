<p>Thread By: TheMikeyMan<br />I wanted to make zetsoubou spiders to replace dog rounds, and I got the model and animation working in game but they don&#39;t do damage on attacking. What I did was just copied the dogs gdts and the am/ast, and just replaced the anims and models, I didn&#39;t change anything else. I&#39;ve looked around in settings in ape I can&#39;t seem to find how to get them to do damage. there is also the hellhound fire fx on them i can&#39;t found how to disable.</p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />The spiders don&#39;t attack because the melee notify is in the dogs&#39; attack animation. You need to make your own script to fix this and remove the fx</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />Or<br /> <br />set up the notetrack callback ( this is what you should do )<br /> <br />or<br /> <br />change the notetrack in the anim to either the zombie or dog notify</p>
