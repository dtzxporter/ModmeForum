<p>Thread By: itznvy<br />Hello everyone! I made this weapon pack because i saw that there wasn&#39;t a weapon pack for bo1. <br />Please read the instructions in the README file. I have included optional slide animations since some of them were glitchy. However they aren&#39;t set by default.<br />There aren&#39;t any wallbuys as of now, also consider this more of a test. <br /> <br />Weapon list:<br />AK47 - My own version of Reznov&#39;s Revenge<br />M1911 - Mustang and Sally included<br />CZ75 <br />FAL<br />M60<br />Stoner 63<br />M16<br />MPL<br />HS10<br />AK74u<br />Famas<br />Galil<br />HK21<br />Dragunov<br />MP40<br />Olympia<br />Commando<br /> <br />Link Removed!<br /> <br />For some great bo1 ports, check out &quot;TheSkyeLord&quot;, sorry<br /> <br />Credits:<br />Jbird632<br />Azsry<br />DTZxPorter<br />Treyarch/Activision</p>
