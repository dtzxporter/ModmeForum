<p>Thread By: NINJAMAN829<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://imgur.com/MMV59Qq.jpg"><br /> <br />Ah. Hello again. It&#39;s me, that one guy who made that one map, back at it again with another one. This time it&#39;s gonna be yuge, so lets get started:<br />&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h1&gt;<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Design: </strong></span>&lt;/h1&gt;<br /> <br /><ul><li><strong>It&#39;s a map centered around the Redwoods Forest in Northern California in the late 2000&#39;s/early 2010&#39;s.</strong><br /><br /><li><strong>The map will be during the late afternoon/early evening with clear skies. An unusual map style.</strong><br /><br /><li><strong>The map will try and be pretty good at looking &quot;real&quot;, like nature would.</strong><br /><br /><li><strong>Has a river and streams.</strong><br /><br /></li></li></li></li></ul>&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h1&gt;<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Features:</strong></span>&lt;/h1&gt;<br /><ul><li><strong>Harry BO21&#39;s template whenever the release will be and most features that encompass it.</strong><br /><br /><li><strong>Many ported weapons from a variety of games; (Bo1-WW2 and others I probably forgot).</strong><br /><br /><li><strong>Some weapons I have ported myself.</strong><br /><br /><li><strong>Good map design; (I hope).</strong><br /><br /><li><strong>An overall enjoyable and nice looking experience.</strong><br /><br /></li></li></li></li></li></ul>&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h1&gt;<span style="color:#ff0000;">Pictures:</span>&lt;/h1&gt;<br /><ul><li><strong>Unfortunately as of now not much of the map has been done, and I prefer showing &quot;completed&quot; sections so there will be a lack of pictures and updates.</strong><br /><br /><li><strong>There will be some pictures though, and if you want, I can post W.I.P shots; (Which will be subject to change or be removed completely in the final product).</strong><br /><br /><li><strong>Here&#39;s the actual pictures/gifs:</strong><br /><br /></li></li></li></ul><br />

Tune in later for some more <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://aviacreations.com/modme/emoticons/wink.png"><br />

<p>Reply By: NINJAMAN829<br />New area that I worked on for a few hours.<br /> <br />Haven&#39;t done that much with the map since I&#39;ve been porting weapons mostly. But I decided I wanted to work on it again.<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://gyazo.com/f8793afed8ff3ea1031ef471a54ffa5d.gif"></p>

<p>Reply By: jackabob<br /><blockquote><em>NINJAMAN829</em><br />Project is cancelled since I fried my hardrives and lost everything.</blockquote><br /> That’s actually heartbreaking. The best thing I can suggest is to look at this as a fresh start. Free to create whatever you want. I understand that this isn’t very positive but sometimes you have to try your best. Much love and appreciation from me.</p>
