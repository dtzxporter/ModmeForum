<p>Thread By: Abnormal202<br />hey I recently released my map REBIRTH on UGX, Zombiemodding, and Modme. I submitted the mod for approval on Modme over a week ago and it still hasn&#39;t been approved or given me any notification. I&#39;ve already come out with another version of the map. I was just wondering, how long does it normally take for something to be approved? I understand if its hard to get to everything and I don&#39;t know how deep you go into testing it, but I&#39;d just like to know if I did something wrong on my end when I submitted it.</p>

<p>Reply By: DTZxPorter<br />To speed up the process while we undergo rapid development, you should message a moderator about it. No one has checked since we&#39;ve been updating our server and client.</p>

<p>Reply By: DTZxPorter<br />Looks like the first reason your first submission was rejected was because it included an EXE installer, all modme mods must be packaged by the client. The new submission will be approved soon.</p>

But then you said Submission will be approved soon? does that mean I&#39;m good to go, or I need to change something? sorry to keep bothering you.</p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />I&#39;ve kind of given up hope now, but is it really still being&quot;worked on&quot; for approval? It&#39;s been an entire month.</p>

There is no ETA for this other than it will take a while.</p>
