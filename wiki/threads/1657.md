<p>Thread By: Wild<br />Is there a good tutorial out there that shows the process of porting BO3 weapons that are not given to us with the tools? I&#39;m a bit afraid to just go in and try different things since I am still learning Maya and I also haven&#39;t really messed with porting weapons too much. I would much rather get a confirmation on what is different between porting BO3 weapons and weapons from other CoD games. So yeah, that&#39;s my question. What&#39;s different when porting BO3&#39;s weapons into custom maps. Is everything the same, I just don&#39;t have to convert the animations? What&#39;s the process for weapons that re already in BO3? I&#39;d just rather be sure of what I need to do instead of blindly going in and either having it not work or I just simply waste time by doing things that I don&#39;t need to do. I hope that makes sense. Any help is appreciated, thank you!</p>

<p>Reply By: DTZxPorter<br />It&#39;s identical to porting a weapon from older Treyarch style games. The only big difference is that you need to rip a pair of viewhands from Black Ops 3 for use as a rig instead of a converison rig. Just rip a zombie players viewhands.</p>
