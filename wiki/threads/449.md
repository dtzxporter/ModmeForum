<p>Thread By: adamk570<br />So the map I am working on has one major eyesore. The light shafts cast from the skybox are angled the wrong way. How do I rotate the skybox itself so that it aligns with the light that it emits?</p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />You can rotate the light. Go in APE, find your sun volume and change pitch and yaw. (updates live in radiant if you have the sun volume selected)</p>

<p>Reply By: adamk570<br />I would like to keep the light the way it is given the way it falls on parts of the map.</p>
