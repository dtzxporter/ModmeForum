<p>So i&#39;ve got no idea what&#39;s wrong with this situation, I&#39;m trying to import the M6g from halo as a weapon and i&#39;m getting this error. It&#39;s in 3 parts so that could be contributing to this??? Also i&#39;ve triple checked and the directory is definitely correct. Thanks for the help.<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.123.jpg' | relative_url }}"></p>

<p>some models aren&#39;t compatible with bo3 due to many reasons. i dont think its your fault here, but you could try exporting the model one more time to be safe. if not the model is trash</p>

<p>the file itself is dodgy</p>

<p>It might have too many vertices. As far as I remember it has to be below 20,000 for BO3 (don&#39;t quote me on that). I use 3dsmax 9, import the xmodel, reduce the verts, then re-export. Always fixes the problem, but you do lose detail. As an alternative, you can always split the model up into multiple models (if you&#39;re good with a 3d program), then re-assemble them as sub-models in APE. That way you keep your level of detail in tact.</p>
