<p>Thread By: AUsernameLz443<br />Hi, I&#39;m planning on porting the Moon hacker tool. I&#39;ve never seen a hacker port from Moon before in all these years. I think there is more to it then just an average port. Is this correct or is the hacker just not interesting enough to port?<br />Note: This is <strong>not</strong> a port request</p>

<p>Reply By: ihmiskeho<br />For the animations and models no problem.<br /> <br />The issue is the scripting part. The hacker requires so many modifications/rewrites to so many scripts. There are so many things you have to modify and so much that can go wrong it&#180;s just not worth the effort for most us.<br /> <br />Similarly how afterlife is so rare in customs. It&#180;s not that people don&#180;t like it, it just that it requires modifications to laststand, perks and so much more.<br /> <br />With that being said, it is possible and there are people who have done the scripts for the hacker (in World at War, not sure about BO3), but it&#180;s a much greater task than a simple weapon port.</p>

That would make sense. You&#39;d have to modify barriers, score, perk machines, mystery box, powerups...<br />Well, thank you very much for the answer.</p>

Though this makes it easier, I don&#39;t think it would be worth for my time, either.<br />I am planning on porting the zap gun. However, again I see no ports of this for black ops 3. Before I accidentally waste my time, are there any &#39;special&#39; scriptings involved for the zap gun? Or has it already been ported via BO3?</p>
