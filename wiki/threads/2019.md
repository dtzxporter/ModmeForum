<p>Thread By: Mr Wafflez<br />I recently tried adding the Apothicon servant through Harry Bo21&#39;s guide but when I shoot it in-game, the effect, sound, etc, spawns but no zombies get sucked in and after the swirling fx is done, all the zombies near it just become invisible and can still hit me (same thing that uused to happen in zns with the kt-4). This is probably just me doing something stupid but I&#39;d appreciate it if anyone knows how to fix it, thanks.</p>

level.b_allow_idgun_pap = 1;
level.idgun_weapons = [];
level.idgun_weapons[ 0 ] = getWeapon( "idgun_0" );
level.idgun_weapons[ 1 ] = getWeapon( "idgun_1" );
level.idgun_weapons[ 2 ] = getWeapon( "idgun_2" );
level.idgun_weapons[ 3 ] = getWeapon( "idgun_3" );
level.idgun_weapons[ 4 ] = getWeapon( "idgun_upgraded_0" );
level.idgun_weapons[ 5 ] = getWeapon( "idgun_upgraded_1" );
level.idgun_weapons[ 6 ] = getWeapon( "idgun_upgraded_2" );
level.idgun_weapons[ 7 ] = getWeapon( "idgun_upgraded_3" );
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />either that or your giving yourself &quot;idgun&quot; not &quot;idgun_0&quot; &quot;idgun_1&quot; etc</p>

Is my GSC bugged or do I need to add it?</p>

Choose that one, compile and link your map, and it&#39;ll fix it.</p>
