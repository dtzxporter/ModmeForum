<p>Reply By: Runis<br />I seem to always have problems with custom weapons that are Launchers. The grim reaper for some reason is spawn able from &quot;/give&quot; but not in the box some times but also non existent some times where I can&#39;t &quot;/give&quot; it. Its weird because those things happen without any changes into my map or scripts. I just launch the map for testing and some times it works and some times it doesn&#39;t.</p>
