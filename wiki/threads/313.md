<p>Thread By: Exofile<br /><p style="text-align:left;">I&#39;m trying to curve off my corners, but end up seeing them a bit wrongly lit up.</p><p style="text-align:left;"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/PkTSrMs.png"></p><p style="text-align:left;">As you can see in the 4 corners, whether they&#39;re inwards or outwards they are lit up differently, and offer a rather higher <em>reflection</em> than the rest. Any particular reason as to why this is, and is there a way I can fix this?</p></p>
