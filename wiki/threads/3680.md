<p>Hello, I&#39;m having a problem with the staff upgrade in one of the weapon packs I&#39;ve been using (Harry&#39;s t7 weapons v3.1.0). The problem I&#39;ve been having is that when I put the staffs into the upgrade pedestal, it doesn&#39;t collect souls and thus I can&#39;t upgrade the staff or get it out. I have the fx and the BT pack installed, and I am also having the problem with the soul chests (they don&#39;t collect souls). If anyone has any idea, this would be very much appreciated!</p>
