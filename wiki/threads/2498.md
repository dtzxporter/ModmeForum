<p>Thread By: Wild<br />I made a post on Reddit that pretty much explains everything. You can find that post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/6rvmsq/cod_the_reason_that_infinity_ward_has_been/">HERE</a>. Basically there is a Twitter account for daily level design inspiration. One day they posted a set of pictures, one of which being this beautiful cliff side next to an ocean. A level designer at Infinity Ward replied saying that these images don&#39;t have playable space, and doesn&#39;t understand how these images are inspiration for design. Now these Infinity Ward devs say things like this, yet we get things in game like the hideous looking ocean in Attack of the Radio Active thing. Put the puzzle together and it makes sense. No wonder Infinity Ward get&#39;s such low ratings on their titles now haha. Also, in that Reddit post there are links to the Tweets showing proof of what I am talking about. Check out the post if you&#39;re interested!</p>
