<p>Reply By: PlutoBro<br />Thanks man, appreciate the work you&#39;ve done for us.<br /> <br />Attempted to follow instructions but led to crash on startup. In APE it says missing images but idk if that&#39;s relevant. Will look into it more to see if it&#39;s an error on my end, the instructions for the ape part were a little off but that might be my understanding :P<br /> <br />Haven&#39;t been modding for literally almost a year so might be slightly rusty at this.<br /> <br />Thanks for the assets man! +1</p>

<p>Reply By: Tjmoney030589<br />Hey, Mike, I am Mr.Zomdingo from the discord. And I am trying to install this and it keeps telling me that the pbt_zm_cdc and pbt_zm_cia is either missing textures or invalid. If this is an error on my part please inform me what I am doing wrong. Thanks for any help!<img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://modme.co/emoticons/happy.png"></p>

<p>Reply By: raanta31<br />Whenever I try to load it it gives me an assertion error maybe I did something wrong in APE I don&#39;t know but if you could tell me that like I imported something wrong and that I&#39;m not just being flat out stupid that would be great <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://aviacreations.com/modme/emoticons/silly.png"></p>

<p>Reply By: VerK0<br />Map crashes on load, I&#39;ve tried:<br />- Double, Triple, Quadtriplechecking the instructions and what i&#39;ve done<br />- Restarted from scratch<br />- Read the FAQ, comments and asked others<br /> <br />There&#39;s no errors present other than the ones you&#39;ve said not to worry about. When running map it exits on the blackscreen.</p>

<p>Reply By: Dick_Nixon<br /><blockquote><em>Erthrock</em><br />can you please post a fix because all this does is cause the game to crash on startup</blockquote><br /> The tricky thing is that I&#39;ve seen maps on the workshop who&#39;ve successfully implemented both my CIA and CDC characters without problems, so in the end, unless you can track the problem down to an extremely specific location, there&#39;s no way I can do anything.</p>
