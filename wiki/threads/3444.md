<p>If I kill a zombie out of bounds and a powerup drops, I want to be able to get it still. I don&#39;t want to disable powerups from dropping but rather have the powerup fly to a set point, I&#39;ve wrapped my brain around this but I&#39;m at a loss. What I&#39;m trying to do is, if the powerup drops within a set volume that the powerup will fly to a script struct, but of very novice when it comes to programming and I don&#39;t even know what type of volume to use, if any of you have any ideas it would be a massive help.</p>
