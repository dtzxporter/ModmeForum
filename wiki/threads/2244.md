<p>Thread By: sanya_rnd<br />I have lots of stuffs on my HDD related to CoD4: my stuffs, other&#39;s stuffs (propably all of them are discontinued already too).<br /><br /><br /><br />All of them at least 3 years old, and I think I can release it already to the public.<br /><br /><br /><br />Link:<br /><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0By31gwkEH7tIRUlwNmE4NUY0OWM">&lt;download data-url=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=0By31gwkEH7tIRUlwNmE4NUY0OWM&quot;&gt;&lt;/download&gt;</a><br /><br /><br /><br />It&#39;s kind of a junkyard with 10GB of data, but I don&#39;t have time to sort it more than it is now (I do not remember what half of this does anyway :) ).<br /><br /><br /><br />I do not release maya sources (yet), but maybe on holidays I&#39;ll cleanup my HDD and put it in shared folder as well. Can&#39;t do it right now, since it&#39;s kind of a mess. I have lots of uncomplete projects and I need to go and sort this out.<br /><br /><br /><br />For those who do not remember me (or do not know me), here&#39;s the channel with examples of my work:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/sanyarnd">https://www.youtube.com/user/sanyarnd</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Please, keep copyright.<br /><br />Many stuffs belongs to me, but some were made by others (usually mentioned in archives).</p>

<p>Reply By: Exofile<br />I&#39;ve gone ahead and embedded your links for easier access.<br /><br /><br /><br />Although I never used the <em>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</em> tools besides importing models into <em>Call of Duty: World at War,</em> it&#39;s nice to see how much work you did with the tools.</p>
