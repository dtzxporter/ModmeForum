<p>Thread By: Ahmed02354<br />So my map does not wanna &#39;&#39;Run&#39;&#39; anymore, meaning that when I wanna test it, it does not load the map, out of nowhere. I can put (as example) /fast_restart or /&#39;&#39;anything else&#39;&#39; but it is just a black screen.<br />Restarted my PC and still...<br /> <br />In radiant its there, I compile the map and no (big) errors disturbing the compiling process. Compiling is done after few seconds/minutes. but does not wanna load up (the map)<br /> <br />I just loaded my map an hour ago it worked normally... Whats the point?</p>

<p>Reply By: easyskanka<br />what have you done to the map since it last loaded? best to carefully backtrack what you have done until you find out what is causing the issue</p>

And now it just doesn&#39;t wanna load</p>

<p>Reply By: easyskanka<br />try removing uptowns keycards and anything you may have done to your GSC scriptwise and see if your map will run again, it may have been something you did while installing his scripts</p>
