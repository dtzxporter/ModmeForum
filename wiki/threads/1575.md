<p>Thread By: avonian<br />ok im not new to porting weapons but ive been getting this more and more, example being my blundergat i reripped it a million times kept binding it and seeing what i do different and it&#39;d have no effect to the issue which is the joints bound with the mesh arent moving at all nor the mesh moving but the arms are obviously moving, so if i import a .seanim or a .mel anim for lets say reload the 2 bullets dont move nor does the gun seperate, or lets say my f-spar torch from infinite warfare, the gun moves around entirely together but when the hands go to pull the mesh and the joint/magazine off of the gun it will stay the same any assistance would be great thanks</p>
