<p>Thread By: TCM<br />I have followed UGX/Video tutorials on how to play the animation on the characters, The problem I am having is that when I look at the animation in APE it looks just fine as seen here<br /> <br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y1yUsGk0vJI" frameborder="0"></iframe> <br /> <br />But when I go into the game its just all kinds of bugged out like this<br /> <br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vh8pzbv5as8" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /> <br />I wasn&#39;t entirely sure why and was just wondering if anyone else had any ideas?<br /> <br /> <br />EDIT MODS CAN DELETE THIS I GOT IT THANK YOU.</p>
