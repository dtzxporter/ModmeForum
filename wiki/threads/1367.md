<p>Thread By: Erneld<br />I made a mod that changes the perk and powerup shaders, and I&#39;d like to have it increase the perk limit as well. I know the code I need to add, for the most part, but I don&#39;t know how to have a script work in a mod, not a map, as every tutorial I find is only applicable towards your own map. Since there isn&#39;t a &quot;function main ()&quot; or &quot;init ()&quot; in the zone file, I&#39;m confused as to how this would work. Any help as to how to have a script work in the &quot;zm_mod.zone&quot; would be greatly appreciated. This is the code that exists in the .zone file right now.<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}

 The code that I would like to implement is:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
init()
{
	thread onplayerconnect();
	//SetDvar("r_enablePlayerShadow", 1); // Causes laser flickering
	level.perk_purchase_limit = 13;
}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
Any and all help is appreciated, thank you for your time. <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://aviacreations.com/modme/emoticons/smile.png"></p>

<p>Reply By: TrueGamerCalls<br />Shameless plug, but use my <a href="http://aviacreations.com/modme/index.php?view=topic&tid=2502%5DTGC%20Mod%20Template">TGC Mod Template</a>, it generates mods with working GSC, CSC, and sound files.</p>

<p>Reply By: Erneld<br /><blockquote><em>TrueGamerCalls</em><br />Shameless plug, but use my TGC Mod Template, it generates mods with working GSC, CSC, and sound files.</blockquote><br /> Thank you <em>VERY </em>much for your help. This will be very useful. I have one question though, is there a function that I can use to give the player the usual starting pistol for the map? Because for SoE, it&#39;s the Bloodhound &quot;pistol_revolver38&quot;, for The Giant and the BO3 DLC maps it&#39;s the MR6 &quot;pistol_standard&quot;, and for the Zombie Chronicles maps it&#39;s the M1911 &quot;pistol_m1911&quot;. Basically, I just want the map to give the starting weapon by default. Other than that, and some things I have to figure out with the differences between GSC and CSC (I know it&#39;s client side and server side, but still some things to figure out), I&#39;ll ask make another thread if I need to. THANK YOU!</p>

Late reply, but I&#39;ve been trying to work on changing the zm_giant map that&#39;s included in the mod tools, and I keep getting an issue with lighting when I export and build the map, and I can&#39;t play it because the game won&#39;t load the map due to not being able to read the fastfile, even though I&#39;ve compiled the lighting multiple times. People are able to make mods that can edit the official BO3 maps, so I&#39;m going to post on the Radiant forum hoping that I get a reply that can lead me to the answer, I want to know how it&#39;s done so bad.</p>

<p>Reply By: Scobalula<br />You&#39;ll need to use an already loaded script to &quot;hook&quot;/load your scripts. People usually use the double points script as it hasn&#39;t changed enough to cause any issues across all maps. From there you&#39;ll call your script and start doing what you need to do.</p>
