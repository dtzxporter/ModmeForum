<p>I was wondering if there was any tutorials out there for a shadows of evil rift to teleport someone, that also includes the fx for the rift and the animation when you go in the rift? I&#39;ve seen a tutorial on the SOE teleporter but it doesn&#39;t seem to also include the actual rift fx or the animation of when you go inside.<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.840.jpg' | relative_url }}"></p>
