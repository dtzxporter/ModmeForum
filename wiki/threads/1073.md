<p>Reply By: XxRaPiDK3LLERxX<br />It&#39;s because of the size of the icons I think, there isn&#39;t like a second icon activated especially for splitscreen use, therefore, you&#39;ll get that big icon.<br /> <br />Basically, you are seeing that big icon because those icons are usually are used in Solo matches, there is no splitscreen icons that are smaller.</p>
