<p>Thread By: HyperionMB<br />So when you edit your own sound alias in the share folder, and you add in the wav files... is that it? When you publish the map will all the sounds and the alias get wrapped with the workshop content? As it stands, if I compile and link my map then go back and re-edit the alias without recompiling or linking, the map still uses the new alias.</p>
