<p>Thread By: ZombieKid164<br />Okay, so I made a post before which said that the fx lights on my map flicker on and off when ever they want, but I&#39;ve found that that isn&#39;t what it is (That also wouldn&#39;t work because lights are not sentient <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://aviacreations.com/modme/emoticons/smile.png">). <em>What actually is happening is after I visit the PaP area on my map, whenever you look certain directions the fx lights go out. </em>What&#39;s weirder is that that only happens for about half the map after you visit PaP. Not sure what is causing this but it really takes the immersion out of my map. I was planning to release my map pretty soon but this is getting in the way. Any help is greatly appreciated. <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://aviacreations.com/modme/emoticons/angel.png"><br />Thanks,<br />-ZombieKid164</p>
