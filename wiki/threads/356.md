<p>Thread By: soul-toktzt<br />Is it possible to cut a part out of a curved texture patch?<br />ex: the middle of a curved patch is lower, and cut out the lowest part so there&#39;s a hole, but it&#39;s also going downhill.</p>

Yeah, i made an alternative option because nothing would work, it&#39;s pretty stupid you can&#39;t cut them tho.</p>
