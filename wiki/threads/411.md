But it&#39;s worth a shot!<br /> <br />You can also place the model of the gun again on the EXACT same spot so you see the gun on the crate already.</p>

<p>Reply By: AnthonyCH<br />You can use this prefabs <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/om9tnicdbpxgtnn/CraftDAnimations+Wall+Buy+Weapon+Prefabs.rar">http://www.mediafire.com/file/om9tnicdbpxgtnn/CraftDAnimations+Wall+Buy+Weapon+Prefabs.rar</a><br />download it then put it in your mod tools. This is all gun for put on a wall, like that you can delete your box.</p>
