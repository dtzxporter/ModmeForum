As far as the start_zone, that is a mistake on your part. I added this problem to the FAQ as if you arent reading closely you can easily misunderstand. In example, this is supposed to be the script_string of your Brutus strtuct:</p><p style="text-align:left;"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://gyazo.com/cbf567bc20a899a1db300b80d7360d31.png"></p></p>

If you take a look at my gdt it should all make sense. Look specifically at the archetype of Brutus </p></p>

Instead add this code to the bottom of your mapname.gsc: </p>{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
function final_door()

	door waittill( "trigger", player ); 
	brutus::spawn_brutus();  // Remove this line if you dont want him to spawn as soon as you open the door
	brutus::init(); // This will start his spawning per rounds 
}

{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br /><br /><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">On your final door give it the KVP: </p><p style="text-align:left;">script_string - final_door</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">Then at in your function main add this: </p>{% highlight php %}{% raw %}

Something similar probably happens in their script.

<p>Reply By: dreamzyy<br />Some people that played private property complained about brutus spawning to much.<br />A guy posted a video where brutus spawned 6 Times in 1 Round, while &quot;level.max_brutus&quot; was set at 3.<br /> <br />Well after looking at the spawn logic, I figured that if you kill brutus right after he spawns ( before the &quot; wait( RandomIntRange( 1, 20 ) ); &quot; is done waiting )<br />he keeps respawning till &quot;level.current_brutuses &lt; level.max_brutus&quot;.<br />That means that I have to have (level.max_brutus = X) X Amount of brutus spawned and walking on the map till the while loop stops and waits for the next round.<br /> <br />Idk if that is intentional or not but I added a var that keeps track of the brutus spawns per round and only lets him spawn (level.max_brutus = X) X Amount of times per round.<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}

<p>Reply By: D-2-K<br /><blockquote><em>dreamzyy</em><br />Some people that played private property complained about brutus spawning to much. A guy posted a video where brutus spawned 6 Times in 1 Round, while &quot;level.max_brutus&quot; was set at 3.   Well after looking at the spawn logic, I figured that if you kill brutus right after he spawns ( before the &quot; wait( RandomIntRange( 1, 20 ) ); &quot; is done waiting ) he keeps respawning till &quot;level.current_brutuses &lt; level.max_brutus&quot;. That means that I have to have (level.max_brutus = X) X Amount of brutus spawned and walking on the map till the while loop stops and waits for the next round.   Idk if that is intentional or not but I added a var that keeps track of the brutus spawns per round and only lets him spawn (level.max_brutus = X) X Amount of times per round. function brutus_spawn_logic() { level endon( &quot;intermission&quot; ); if( isDefined( level.brutus_debug ) &amp;&amp; level.brutus_debug ) level thread spawn_brutus(); level.next_brutus_round = RandomIntRange( level.min_brutus_round, level.max_brutus_round+1 ); nsz_iprintlnbold( &quot;The Next brutus Round: &quot;+level.next_brutus_round ); while(1) { level waittill( &quot;between_round_over&quot; ); level.current_round_brutuses = 0; // keeps track of the brutus spawns per round and resets when the next round starts if( level.round_number == level.next_brutus_round ) { level.next_brutus_round = level.round_number + RandomIntRange( level.min_brutus_round, level.max_brutus_round+1 ); if( isDefined(level.next_dog_round) &amp;&amp; level.next_brutus_round == level.next_dog_round ) level.next_brutus_round++; while( level.current_brutuses &lt; level.max_brutus &amp;&amp; level.current_round_brutuses &lt; level.max_brutus ) // stops the loop when spawns hit the max brutus you want ( per round ) { wait( RandomIntRange( 1, 20 ) ); if( level.current_brutuses &lt; level.max_brutus &amp;&amp; level.round_number &gt;= level.multiple_brutus_round ) { level.current_round_brutuses++; level spawn_brutus(); } else if( level.current_brutuses &lt; level.max_brutus ) { level spawn_brutus(); break; } } } } }</blockquote><br /><blockquote>Been testing your update to the script for a couple of days as i was having the brutus spawn issues myself and i can confirm that your tweek to the script has been working perfectly on every occasion of testing </blockquote><br /><blockquote>+1 from me </blockquote><br /><blockquote>P.S Does anyone know how Nates Getting on haven&#39;t seen him in a while</blockquote></p>

Not to mention GSC I am very familiar with look up my GSC menu&#39;s for BO2 as its the biggest and most widely used one as well as my C# applications, Don&#39;t go calling someone a kid for asking a question and trying to get an answer while working on other stuff at the same time.<br /> <br />But as I said I am not here to argue with you, You can throw insults all day say anything and everything you want, Its not worth my time.<br />Drop it and move on, I have had the flu for a week and in a bad mood, But I did prove my point in it all, I just wanted to see if it was happening for anyone else as well as I didn&#39;t see it was and didn&#39;t know if they had the issue as well, I am pretty sure that input is needed for these types of things as I am sure that could happen to anyone.

I would get back on track with this thread before one of the mods yell at us.</blockquote><br /> <br />In the heat of the moment and all of the arguing I still said I like his stuff and he does good work, He just has to put everything I have done down, Sure I am not the best at it and everyone needs help at times, But again, I am tired of the arguing I wouldn&#39;t mind if the mods deleted all the replies that are not relevant to the thread and move on with the day.</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />lol im just gonna laugh at the fact he pointed out that &quot;its more than just dvars&quot; when &quot;dvars&quot; is just &quot;one&quot; of the things i mentioned ( dvars.... AND engine / api functions and functions other people made and share on those dodgy websites )<br /> <br /> <br />and &quot;one or two things you have created&quot; ... LOLOLOLOLOLOLOOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOOLOOL<br /> <br /> <br />and if by &quot;have a go at everyone&quot; you mean &quot;point out to people who grab absolutely anything and shove it in over and over and over again&quot; - yes - i do lol<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />I wouldnt have &quot;put your stuff down&quot; if you hadnt brought it up to &quot;prove&quot; you know &quot;a lot about gsc&quot; either<br /> <br />and never gave you attitude in the first place, just literally  said &quot;remove brutus or remove the IDgun&quot; - and told you the answer to your question...<br /> <br /> <br />also company? lol uh huh<br /> <br />I had a shit this morning, you wanna know about that?<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Also if that video link to &quot;nazi_zombie_beast&quot; was supposed to prove your &quot;skill&quot; - protip, dont bother next time lol. anything that wasnt stock in that - was downloaded of ugx, including the bank, which says UGX BANK at the top, or ugxs zombie counter, the hintstrings are fucked trying to load localized ones that dont exist, your fps is a steady &quot;11&quot;, your textures cant even load in, the map is god awful -using textures for a barbed fence around a outside area with no background ( just endless void ), or using the corner brick blend texture as a floor for example, theres nothing at all unique in it and i can tell what few things you have done, because its the dumb stuff you had to use words like &quot;shit&quot; or &quot;beast&quot; in - eg the barrier &quot;hold F to clear this shit&quot; or the colt called &quot;best pistol&quot; lol<br /> <br />^ has more dislikes than likes, even considering how low both numbers are and one of the few comments is &quot;<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/tinnetju">&lt;span class=&quot;style-scope ytd-comment-renderer&quot;&gt;Tinne&lt;/span&gt;</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcBUl3UruBs&lc=UgwNZ8VTBBX6D6p2vLp4AaABAg">5 years ago</a><br /><br />full of glitches and its a bit to &quot;rainbowy/gay&quot; for me. No thanks&quot;<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />now - lets stop measuring dicks, grow some balls to go with it and move on with life<br /> <br /> <br />p.s - learn the meaning of &quot;hypocritical&quot;</p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br /><blockquote><em>TCM</em><br />&quot; I&#39;m sick and not in the mood to deal with bs&quot; &quot; I am done arguing with you&quot; &quot; I am tired of the arguing&quot;</blockquote><br /> Then stop replying - you can&#39;t win one of these I&#39;m afraid. ESPECIALLY not by showing off whatever you&#39;ve made in the community, that very quickly turns into a dick-measuring contest.<br /> <br />Like seriously, every comment you write is only gonna dig you deeper, even if you think there are good points being made.<br /> <br /> <br />I know Harry&#39;s &quot;tough love&quot; can be annoying at times, but trust me its for the better. At least he gives help (not that many people do these days).</p>
