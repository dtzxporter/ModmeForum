<p>Thread By: Scobalula<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/egtdqDo.png"><br /> <br />This tool will read CSV files with Call of Duty Weapon stats stored in them, specifically Marvel4’s raw spreadsheets (i.e. with headers named the same as those used in APE/Asset Manager.) and save them to a GDT. I made this tool in less than a few hours but I hope it saves most people countless hours in copying stats from a raw spreadsheet.<br /> <br />NOTE: When reading Marvel4’s statesheets, make sure to click “Raw Weapons” tab and download as a CSV, if a stat sheet of his does not have a Raw Spreadsheet then those stats can’t be used as it does not work with the other spread sheets with formatting, etc.<br /> <br />The tool also allows you to select weapon type, and that is stored on the selected weapon so you don’t need to keep changing it for a particular weapon and if you want to run through then do save all.<br /> <br />Credit:<br /> <br /><ul><li>Collie (Suggesting it)<br /><br /><li>Marvel4 (Raw Weapon Stats being the reason this was made that are on point)<br /><br /><li>Amazing people of Stackoverflow (me still C# nublet)<br /><br /></li></li></li></ul>Download/Home Page:<br /> <br /><a href="https://philmaher.me/CSVWeaponStatReader/">Download</a></p>
