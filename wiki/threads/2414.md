<p>Thread By: The Black Death<br />With the release of the anticipated Black Ops IIII game, it seems only suitable that there be a rig for converting viewmodel animations to T7 form.<br /> <br /><strong>Credits:</strong><br />- DTZxPorter<br />- Scobalula<br />- Azsry<br />- Collie<br />- ID-Daemon<br />- Blak<br /> <br /><strong>Exporting an XAnim</strong><br />General: select t7:tag_torso + t7:tag_cambone, <strong>THEN</strong> select -&gt; hierarchy<br />ADS: select t7:tag_view + t7:tag_torso, <strong>DO NOT</strong> select -&gt; hierarchy<br /> <br /><strong>Disclaimers</strong><br />- Although it may not be widespread known, you do not have to add the _t7 suffix to import animations any more. In one of SE Tools&#39; updates, Porter gave the priority for non-namespaced joints to be animated over namespaced ones.<br />- A shelf is <strong>not </strong>provided in the download.<br />- If you want to have a TX shelf move the gun to its skeletal position, this can still be done, but beware that the gun will be renamed to j_gun, and to prevent error you need to rename it back to tag_weapon.<br />- If animations appear stretched and the gun is not in the hands, and you *know* it&#39;s a viewmodel animation, you have not patched the animation with Scobalula&#39;s SEAnimPatcher. It can be found on Modme or on his repo; <a href="https://github.com/Scobalula/SEAnimPatcher">https://github.com/Scobalula/SEAnimPatcher</a><br />- And finally, this is a pretty early rig, and I can&#39;t guarantee that there won&#39;t be problems. The rig is simple as 3arc appears to have kept t7 in mind when making the t8 rig, so results should be 1:1, but if you encounter an issue please let me know.<br /> <br /><strong>Download</strong><br /><a href="https://mega.nz/#!acEUjaoa!VZcCFU7-HI8iyZWBv9zmGcKDoVhHYhyoDRCejRY4jDA">Download</a></p>

<p>Reply By: MadxXx<br />Thanks for all the answers<br /> <br />I guess the following is maybe a solution for my problem:<br /> <br /><strong>Someone who could open the file (Maya2016 or newer?)<br /></strong><br /><strong>Open the Maya Binary (.mb) file from the download (Open Maya --&gt; File --&gt; Open Scene --&gt; Select &quot;Blak T8-T7 Rig.mb&quot; --&gt; Hit Open)</strong><br /><strong>After Maya loaded the scene, all should be saved as a Maya ASCII (.ma) File (Go to --&gt; File --&gt; Export All --&gt; Choose Save Location --&gt; Enter New Name --&gt; Select &quot;Files of type&quot;: Maya ASCII --&gt; Hit Export All)</strong><br /> <br />This new saved file should be working with Maya2012, Maya2013 and so on ...<br /> <br />I am to stupid for the FBX format ^^<br /> <br />Hope someone could do that<br /> <br />Greetings and thanks in advance!</p>
