<p>Sorry to advertise but a guy made a discord server for people who want to play blackout. We play pretty much every day. If there are enough people we do the big map, otherwise Alcartraz. Worst case custom games. We usually play at around 6 UTC<br /><br />Link: <a href="https://discord.gg/FUbGY8T">https://discord.gg/FUbGY8T</a><br /><br />Edit: New link</p>
