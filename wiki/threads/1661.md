<p>Thread By: BlackMamba231<br />I was doing a bit of research online and I found out it is possible to rip models from TellTale&#39;s TWD games. So I was wondering if there was any way I would be able to &quot;port&quot; them (idk if that&#39;s the correct word) so I could use them in my map.<br /> <br />I found this:<a href="https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=11687">https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=11687</a><br /> <br />Like I said, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s possible to do this but maybe one of the guys here that are good at this can help me out.</p>

<p>Reply By: JellyAlex<br />It is likely you will have to rip the models, scale them to the right size, rig them and custom animate them. Unless the anims can be exported into maya, this is what you will have to do.<br /> <br />I&#39;ve done this with far cry 4 before so I can help you a bit if you want however you need a bit of maya anim experience to do this.</p>
