<p>Thread By: ProRevenge<br />So I&#39;m working on the China Lake port for BO3, and it doesn&#39;t use any stock shell eject, and also doesn&#39;t conventionally play them on the fire anim like most guns do.<br /> <br />I made a custom shell eject by taking the pistol one and adding the China&#39;s empty shell model to it, all is well so far.<br />I then added it to the weapon as an FX Notetrack on the Rechamber and Reload_in anims, where its supposed to have the eject, using &quot;Play Viewmodel FX&quot; on &quot;tag_brass&quot;<br /> <br />However:<br />When I Rechamber, the shell ejects correctly from the weapon, but a second comes out of the player&#39;s face and flies forward<br />When I Reload_in, the shell only flies out of the player&#39;s face.<br /> <br />It is set up the same as a notetrack on each anim.<br /> <br />Has anyone worked with custom shell ejects or FX notetracks before who would know whats going wrong here?</p>
