<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br />I haven&#39;t played the map you are talking about (have barely played even most 3arc maps lol) but does the player actually get damaged in the fire? or are they falling into the fire and then teleporting? If they are falling into the fire without damage and as soon as they touch it they teleport, it is significantly easier to do</p>

<p>Reply By: Hypercaine<br />There is a teleporter script here from wakka, If i understand what you are saying then this will do half of what you are asking, I have this placed under my whole map in case the player falls off :). It then teleports the player back to a set location, That i happen to have set up as spawn.
