<p>Reply By: iAr7uRo<br /><blockquote><em>Tjmoney030589</em><br /></blockquote><br /> Thanks for the models with that I think I can detail my map more, but I think it would be better if the files upload them in .RAR or .ZIP created by you. Because as you put it in the folder by MEGA it is slower to download. Because MEGA creates the .zip file and then starts downloading but one by one of all the assets. :c<br /> <br />Even so thank you very much men. :D</p>

<p>Reply By: XxRaPiDK3LLERxX<br />Nice you&#39;ve got a win for me :)<br />I&#39;d also recommend using that download button format to make it easier for people to view the link instead of copy and paste - it&#39;ll be on the second row when you edit your post.</p>

<p>Reply By: Tjmoney030589<br />Yes I know, I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t realize that at first and I haven&#39;t had time to go back and fix them in APE.</p>

<p>Reply By: ZeRoY<br />Had a quick glance, still a lot of TGA in there and some green maps too - ideally BO2 model need to have AO created also. Less problematic is lack of LODs</p>

<p>Reply By: Tjmoney030589<br />Hey Zeroy, I just started modding June 2017 so I&#39;m still pretty wet behind the ears when it comes to the lingo lol <br />I really want to learn all aspects of modding because I enjoy it so much, so could you or someone else explain what those things are? These were the first models I ever did all help would be appreciated. I also sent you a private message but I&#39;m not sure if it went through. Thanks for any help :)</p>
