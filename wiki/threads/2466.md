<p>Thread By: Scobalula<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/dmQlHnX.png"><br />This tool will allow you to merge SEAnim&#39;s, I had a Python version of this for ages but never got around to patching it up for release, so decided to rewrite it in C#.<br /> <br />While Porter recently fixed some copy frames stuff in SETools (like within the last half an hour of me typing this) this tool shall still prove useful to you in merging entire SEAnim files together (such as fire/settles) into a spectacular single SEAnim.<br /> <br />Download from Github:<br /> <br /><a href="https://github.com/Scobalula/SEAnimMerger/releases">Download</a> <br /> <br /><br />
I just noticed that is section is just Porter and I with some RDV and Dual thrown in.
