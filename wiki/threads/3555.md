<p>[USER=3728]@bubba443[/USER]  thats weird.  check the build log for errors. i think it should load default sounds though if i messed something up.<br /><br />also my discord is Koenttje#8490 if you need faster response<br /><br />EDIT: i checked my instructions and sound assets. it should work fine.</p>

<p>I tried adding you on discord and that name doesn&#39;t seem to work. Can you try adding ImTwisted#6049?<br /><br />Also, I can hear the loop_00.wav playing, but the powerup sounds don&#39;t seem to be playing<br /><br />I have tried about 5 different powerup mods and nothing works. It for sure on my end. If you could help me I would greatly appreciate it.</p>
