<p>Thread By: TheRealHealz<br />So I&#39;m working with some custom models to do a map, the problem is that some of them are fine, but others have like 1 side transparent and the other is fine, but in Maya it works perfectly. I wouldn&#39;t really car but that would be if the ones inside the map were visible, but they aren&#39;t, do I have to just scrap my idea, or is there some way to fix this?</p>

I looked at the model without adding the materials added and they were transparent inside but not outside, (its a room btw) and I&#39;ve done the same when I add the materials.</p>

On another note, you&#39;re certain the inside actually has faces?</p>

I just started using Maya about a week ago, but everything looks fine in Maya, but I&#39;ll look into it and see if that is it.</p>
