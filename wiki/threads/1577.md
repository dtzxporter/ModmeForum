<p>Thread By: AA191<br />I&#39;m having trouble when it comes to View Models and World models for a weapon port from AW. When I have initial LOD 0 maya file, all I get is an &quot;FX&quot; in the world. Not only that, I don&#39;t have any images on the image file. And I do this all from wraith. It would be much obliged if I can get help. Thank ye</p>

<p>Reply By: avonian<br />I use to get this too I figured out they are super like super duper picky when it comes to this you have to be holding the weapon in a custom game or multiplayer game in AW then do it</p>
