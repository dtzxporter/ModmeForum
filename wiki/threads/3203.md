<p>I click the tab to open FX Browser but nothing pops up in Radiant. Is there something extra I am supposed to install for the FX? I already have the addition 91gb asset pack so I dont think that could be it. Does anyone know how I could fix it? Thanks.</p>

Or does the whole window not pop up?<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.679.png' | relative_url }}"></p>
