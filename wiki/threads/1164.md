<p>Thread By: Noah Gamerscore<br />So I have pictures ready (at least I think they are ready) to use for the characters pictures replacement. Is there a script I need to change the characters picture to a custom one. If you are confused when I say<br />&quot;characters picture&quot;, then here is an example :<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/CAVgvdm.jpg"><br />Any help would be greatly appreciated, and thanks for taking your time to help out.</p>

<p>Reply By: xMG<br />I <strong><span style="color:#ffffff;">THINK </span></strong><span style="color:#ffffff;">they change when you change the character model.</span></p>

<p>Reply By: Wild<br />Don&#39;t know if this works but if you try and rip the images for them with wraith and they actually show up then you can probably change them the same way you would change the perk shaders. Worth a try</p>

Because I was trying to do this but the characters pictures were in &quot;t7 missing asset pack&quot; and still doesn&#39;t work but ill have to try and get them from Wraith.<br /> <br />Edit : Just tried it and still nothing works.</p>

I tried something like that but had &quot;include&quot; instead of &quot;image&quot;. But thank you man. I&#39;ll test it out when I get home later today. Thanks again!!</p>

But thanks for the help man, appreciate it.</p>
