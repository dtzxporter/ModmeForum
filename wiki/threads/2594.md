<p>Hi<br />Anyone know if is possible to change the power ups to only the player pick up will be affected?<br /><br />For example like in the Rush mode in BO4. If you pick a Max Ammo only the player who pick it up would received the ammo and same as the other power ups</p>

<p>You would need to edit _zm_powerup_full_ammo.gsc to only affect the player passed into it (the script as it is loops over each player on the player&#39;s team) and for the effects to change you need to remove the exclamation mark before POWERUP_ONLY_AFFECTS_GRABBER.<br /><br />Then you can just include it in your zone as normal to override the script in-game.</p>
