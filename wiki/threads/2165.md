I kept some areas hidden for a reason). I&#39;ve been working on this map ever since the mod tools came out in September 2016. I&#39;ve still got quite a bit of important things to add to the map, like a game-ending easter and some sort of boss fight. I don&#39;t want to give too much away about the map, but know that I have spent hundreds and hundreds of hours on it, and there are plenty of secrets .</p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;">The song is called: <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/555449">Atrtdsrwiflaetfotl</a> (can you believe thats even a name?)</p><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><br /><p style="text-align:left;">EDIT:<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=891509353">IT&#39;S OUT NOW!</a></p></p>
