Error: Failed to export unnamed.map because Unable to process the zone file. Make sure to export from the top map and that the zone file is properly configured.
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
<br /><br /><br />Thats the error code if I want to build my map. If this comes my map is broken and will open a blank map. I got this on 3 maps. Any solution?</p>
