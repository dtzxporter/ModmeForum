<p>Thread By: modric<br />When playing my map, all brushes are invisible. Models are still visible and the ground brush that the player spawns on shows, but all other brushes are invisible but collidable. The other weird issues are that zombies are not knifable and that the player cannot take damage. I have not done anything drastic to my map that would result in any of these bugs, i added some brushes and sounds, which i have since reverted but the bugs remain.</p>
