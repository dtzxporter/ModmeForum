<p>Thread By: Nightmare_Pie<br />I was wandering if anybody had any idea how to resolve this issue. I can not be in a party in zombies because it tells me that some party members do not have the content installed, even though I am the only one in the party and I have zombies installed, plus the season pass. I have validated the steam files a few times now and made several bug reports.</p>

<p>Reply By: mrpeanut188<br />I&#39;d like to request this too, the few times I&#39;ve tried to play BO3 I&#39;ve run into this error. A fix would be amazing, but can&#39;t find anything.</p>
