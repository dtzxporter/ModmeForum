<p>Hi,<br />How can i get different actor spawners to only spawn their zombies in a certain area or zone.<br />I&#39;ve seen it in a couple of maps before but can&#39;t find any direction to how it is done.<br />I tried SetEnemyModel but that doesn&#39;t seem to work. Any help is appreciated!<br /><br />Spawners have a kvp called SM Priority which is a spawn manager? Is there a way to switch from false to true through a script or something like that?</p>
