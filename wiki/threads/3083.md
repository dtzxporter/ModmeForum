<p>As the title states, I am looking for Alpha Omega Models for a project that I&#39;m working on. Currently I haven&#39;t found anything on the forums for Alpha Omega models and I don&#39;t have access to Black Ops 4 on PC so I&#39;m turning to you guys for help.<br /><br />&quot;Direct Message me on discord for more questions&quot;<br />- <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Garrett#1215</strong></span></p>
