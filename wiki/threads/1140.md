<p>Thread By: Wild<br />Hello, I am currently working on a script for a perkaholic easter egg. Whenever you complete the easter egg sam laughs and I don&#39;t want her to. I don&#39;t know why she does, it&#39;s most likely from the giving of the perks. Anyway, does anyone know how to essentially mute her via script? The alias for her laugh is &quot;zmb_laugh_child&quot;. Is there any possible way to lets say mute that aliase for like 10 seconds or just prevent it from playing at all from a function or something? Thanks!</p>

What do you mean a patch sound? I&#39;ve never even heard of that.<br /> <br />Anyway I already know why the laugh plays, I was asking how to prevent it. Inside a script instead of replacing the aliases with a silent sound or something.</p>
