<p>I&#39;m hoping this is the right section, i tried my best to find its best spot.<br /><br />I&#39;m getting the following errors anytime i attempt to compile/link my map after bringing in a ported weapon:<br />ERROR: D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops III\sound_assets\skye_ports\t8_rampart17\foley\wpn_t8_rampart17_hit.wav<br /><br /><br />ERROR: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.<br /><br /><br />I&#39;m even getting this when creating a new map, and I know that some of these have worked before just fine. It seems to be an issue with the snd_converter.exe<br /><br />I reinstalled the mod tools and still get this error :|<br /><br />The result of this is that none of my dang sounds end up working for these weapons<br /><br /><br />ANY help will be appreciated.</p>

<p>Sound converter is fine - you have a sound alias added to the csv that all maps share which is pointing at a missing sound</p>
