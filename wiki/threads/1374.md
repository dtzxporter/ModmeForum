<p>Thread By: Vekah<br />I would like my map to be similar to Kino der toten, in the sense that you can choose to go different ways from spawn. <br />My problem is I don&#39;t know how to make a door be able to open one zone from one side, and another zone from the other side. <br />For example, how can you make it so you can go all the way around the map clockwise, as well as doing it anti-clockwise if you want to.<br />I&#39;ve looked everywhere and can&#39;t find how to do this, thanks :)</p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />When you put this line in your mapname.gsc:<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
zm_zonemgr::add_adjacent_zone( "start_zone", "zone1", "zone_start-1");
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />It means that the two zones, &quot;start_zone&quot; and &quot;zone1&quot; are considered adjacent, or touching. When the flag &quot;zone_start-1&quot; is called (for example by a zombie door), <strong>both</strong> zones are activated. Therefore it doesn&#39;t matter whether the player is coming from &quot;start_zone&quot; into &quot;zone1&quot; or &quot;zone1&quot; into &quot;start_zone&quot;, <strong>both</strong> zones will be activated, even if one is already active.<br /> <br />so it&#39;s really as simple as having a trigger on either side of the zombie_door sharing the same flag with each other.</p>

Also, would even be worth making a map at this point? (I&#39;m not sure if bo4 will have mod tools?)</p>

They don&#39;t want to provide modtools during their DLC season. So I wouldn&#39;t worry about that.</p>
