<p>I&#39;m using Icegernade&#39;s shootable easter egg and I&#39;ve changed some of the thresholds to take more damage before the trigger activates. How can I make the trigger take more damage if there are more than one player in the game (similar to how in boss fights, the bosses take more damage if there are more players in the game) hopefully this makes sense, any help is appreciated</p>

<p>players = GetPlayers();<br />    if(players &gt; 1)<br />    {<br />        damage+100;<br />    }</p>
