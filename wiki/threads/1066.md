It&#39;s almost like you forgot the backspace key. How do you expect someone to take the time to help you if you can&#39;t even take the time to write an actual sentence?<br /> <br />Sorry if that&#39;s salty, but c&#39;mon.</p>

But it&#39;s also important to remember that no one will answer your cry for help if they can&#39;t understand it, or if it looks like you just don&#39;t care. I personally would help you out now, but I have no idea how to add in another  double PaP. I know that all the files for that are contained in ROOT\Share\Raw\Scripts\Zm\aats if you wanna look there.</p>
