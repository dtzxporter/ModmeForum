<p>Thread By: raygunner<br />WARNING: NavVolume generation is skipped. Flying units might not behave correctly. This might be due to there is no nav_volume brush in the level, or the generation is skipped purposely by skipping -navvolume option.<br /> <br />that&#39;s what the launcher says when compiling and when I launch the map the zombies stand still</p>

So............ <br />verify there is no nav mesh ...launch map, in console type      /developer 1      followed by      /Ai_showNavmesh 1   <br />This should show the nav mesh in yellow on the floor. If it is there go back into radiant and check the kvps on the zombies nodes....script_string (value) findflesh  script_noteworthy (value) riser_ location  and or script_string (value) receiver_set_entery_ a     entery must match the barrier targetname. while in radaint also verify that you still have a info_player_start and didnt delete it by accident.<br /> <br />Good luck</p>

<p>Reply By: Symbo<br />Navvolume is for flying ai. Btw i had navmesh issues i couldnt solve or understand. I found out if you place several pathnodes it generate small navmesh spots.</p>
