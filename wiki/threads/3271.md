<p>Hi guys, after editing my map the floor became invisible in game. The floor is still visible in the radiant and radiant game view. Also the zombies are unable to hit me and i am unable to knife. I&#39;m not sure if the errors are related as i am fairly new to mapping. Photo + video can be provided (file is too big for post). Thanks!</p>

<p>Maybe you by accident used a blend texture...</p>
