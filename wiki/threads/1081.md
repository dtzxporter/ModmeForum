Thank you  So you want it to be pretty similar too the shadows of evil ritual? if you do then ill try to see what to do but im not into the scripting alot</blockquote><br /> Yes, very similar to shadows of evil.<br />I have tried: <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
zombie_utility::set_zombie_var( "zombie_score_kill", 0 );
zombie_utility::set_zombie_var( "zombie_score_damage", 0 );
zombie_utility::set_zombie_var( "zombie_score_damage_normal", 0 );
zombie_utility::set_zombie_var( "zombie_score_damage_light", 0 );
zombie_utility::set_zombie_var( "zombie_score_bonus_melee", 0 );
zombie_utility::set_zombie_var( "zombie_score_bonus_head", 0 );
zombie_utility::set_zombie_var( "zombie_score_bonus_neck", 0 );
zombie_utility::set_zombie_var( "zombie_score_bonus_torso", 0 );
zombie_utility::set_zombie_var( "zombie_score_bonus_burn", 0 );
zombie_utility::set_zombie_var( "zombie_score_kill_4player", 0 );
zombie_utility::set_zombie_var( "zombie_score_kill_3player", 0 );
zombie_utility::set_zombie_var( "zombie_score_kill_2player", 0 );
zombie_utility::set_zombie_var( "zombie_score_kill_1player", 0 );
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
But, this had no effect.</p>

My dumba** accidentally threaded the function, which caused the next function that would re-enable the earning of points to be called immediately after. DOH!<br />So the code worked all along. Sorry to waste your time!</p>
