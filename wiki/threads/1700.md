<p>Thread By: eDeK<br />Hi, im testing and i changed the &quot;Brutus&quot; with other model, others bones and others animations. (But keeping the same names of &quot;xmodels/xanims&quot;)<br />Inside the game &quot;Brutus&quot; play correctly the animations &quot;run, melee, spawn, etc...&quot;, the problem is he dont move, he stay in the same spot with the animation &quot;running&quot; and the animation &quot;melee attack&quot; dont give me damage when he hit me.<br />i tried to add others tags like &quot;tag_origin, tag_aim, tag_sync, etc...&quot; but he dont run around the map.<br />The new bones are the problem?</p>
