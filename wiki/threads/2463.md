<p>Thread By: Scobalula<br />So I decided to add support for more games from previous to my tool. :P<br /> <br />Usage is simple and same as IW6 version, just drag and drop FFs onto the exe.<br /> <br />Supports: CoD 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10.<br /> <br />For CoD Bo1 use BassDrop, for Bo2, Bo3 and IW use Wraith, for Paks of Ghosts/AW use Wraith.<br /> <br />Download:<br /> <br /><a href="So%20I%20decided%20to%20add%20support%20for%20more%20games%20from%20previous%20to%20my%20tool.%20:P%20%20Usage%20is%20simple%20and%20same%20as%20IW6%20version,%20just%20drag%20and%20drop%20FFs%20onto%20the%20exe.%20%20Supports:%20CoD%204,%205,%206,%208%20and%2010.%20%20For%20CoD%20Bo1%20use%20BassDrop,%20for%20Bo2,%20Bo3%20and%20IW%20use%20Wraith,%20for%20Paks%20of%20Ghosts/AW%20use%20Wraith.%20%20Download:%20%20https://github.com/Scobalula/CoDFFSoundExporter/releases%20%20Github%20page:%20%20https://github.com/Scobalula/CoDFFSoundExporter">Download</a>Github page:<br /> <br /><a href="https://github.com/Scobalula/CoDFFSoundExporter">https://github.com/Scobalula/CoDFFSoundExporter</a></p>

<p>Reply By: Collie<br />Fantastic, I cannot thank you enough for this. I&#39;ve been really hoping someone would release a tool sooner or later to extract Ghosts&#39; FF sounds. Doing it by hand via hex editing was a serious pain in the ass. Once again, thank you.<br /> <br />On top of that, these sound completely on point compared to the ones I extracted by hand.</p>

<p>Reply By: Scobalula<br />The tool works fine on CoD 4 (and also MW2/3 since they share same export method). <br /> <br />You can also try my newer tool Rottweiler which is written in C#, features a GUI and supports MWR/AW as well.</p>
