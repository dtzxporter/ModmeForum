<p>Depends on perks version and it could be an lua isssue... perk versions past 2.0.0 i believe all use lua for icons by default so look in his instructions to either change the icons to use GSC instead of LUA or just get leakmod set up. Also check ape to make sure the perk materials are using the right images</p>
