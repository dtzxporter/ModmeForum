<p>Reply By: TheJaguarPlays<br />I&#39;m probably gonna sound really dumb, but could I ask what this is for exactly or what is does or how it works. I think by the looks it has to do with the coloring of the lights or like the map but I&#39;m not sure what it exactly does. Could you explain that to me?</p>

Open your map in Radiant, and with nothing selected open the entity browser and change the lutmaterial to one of the names in the .txt.</p>
