<p>Thread By: MJPW<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Hi there! Sorry for the frequent posts but if Im having these issuse I figured that maybe someone else might as well in the future. So currently my the main bit of setting up a custom perk didnt have the part where if you have the perk, you couldnt get the perk again. The perk does take away however. Thankfully PROxFTW helped me out with a fix to where the perk machine will not let you buy the perk anymore after you have it. But now Ive came across a bigger issue with it: when picking up a &quot;free perk&quot; power up, you can continue to get the perk with no end.</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">I tried replicating the clientfield options like in the other perk files but I get a clientfield error when you try to start the game.</p></p>

<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br /><p style="text-align:left;">I cant say for sure what is happening but it sounds like you might be stuck inside the give_perk_function that you are using. I cant recall if it is the same for perks as it is with the powerups, but the give_perk_function needs to complete for the after effects of the stock _zm_perks.gsc to take place.</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">You appear to be caught up on the clientfields, but dont be. I actually did all of Madgaz&#39;s perks with no clientfields as I dont feel competent enough with csc to have any advantage over gsc. Clientfields are related to csc/LUA functions if my understanding is correct, so you simply dont need to set clientfields if you dont use csc/LUA for your perk. </p></p>

<br /></blockquote><p style="text-align:left;">Next time use the code sample button. </p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">You shouldnt have to do some anything additional to get this to work so I suggest removing any added code from PROxFTW to isolate the problem. What are the KVP&#39;s of your trigger and of your script_struct in your prefab. They should both have the same script_noteworthy. </p></p>

<p>Reply By: MJPW<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Sorry about that. The think parts are what is additional to keep from purchasing it again. In the custom perk tutorial they didnt include a trigger section only a script_struct. </p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">The struct has targetname/zm_perk_machine and script_noteworthy/speciality_customperk</p></p>

<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Add a trigger_use with the following KVP&#39;s, just change your specialty: </p><p style="text-align:left;"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://gyazo.com/5263974b0155c306d42407c3b4cc5a5d.png"></p></p>

<p>Reply By: MJPW<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Okay just tried it and now I can continue to buy the perk as many times as I please again along with, for some odd reason, it doesnt actually give me the full perk (with its main use it just shows the shader) unless I get it in the power up drop.</p></p>

I would find someone who has used his tut and confirm that his tut/scripts are not entirely correct. If that is the case I can try to type up a tut on it after I finish Brutus because I am getting loads of messages asking for him. </p></p>

But if you did it that would be awesome :) Brutus would be pretty cool to see in BO3</p></p>
