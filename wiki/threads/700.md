<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br />If you are asking the question because you saw a Brutus model was included in the latest update: the included model is incomplete and the exact same as the bo2 model. No script was included and its a mystery as to why it was included at all. So basically you need to script it all from scratch.</p>
