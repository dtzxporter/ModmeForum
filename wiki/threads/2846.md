<p>Hi <br /><br />Was wondering anyone would be able to help me in creating a custom powerup or custom perk. I have 2 ideas, just wanted to run it by someone capable of creating one or the other (or both) as I’m solely a mapper and haven’t any experience behind the scripting and creation of either one</p>

<p><blockquote>i can maybe, depends what they do<br /></blockquote><br /><br /><br />Just toying with the ideas atm<br />Depending on if people think it would be interesting or not<br /><br />Primarily they are both more relevant to a prison map im making at the moment so the names and theme of them are based within that idea as a whole<br /><br />but what i had in mind were these::<br /><br />1.

Perk - Riot Control Rum (Placeholder name)<br />Havent figured out what would trigger it, whether it be sliding/reloading/shooting etc<br />General idea is to have a gas emit surrounding the player that causes the surrounding zombies to be stunned and not move<br />With the chance of having a, or multiple, zombie(s) turn<br /><br />Appreciate you even taking an interest in the post, even if this doesnt amount to anything. <br />Just trying to do my part in providing some fresh spins on things</p>

<p>sounds doable, brutus bit could be tricky, i assume its nsz&#39;s one. tricky part is stopping him from disabling things as an ally, but i havent looked at that script so maybe not</p>
