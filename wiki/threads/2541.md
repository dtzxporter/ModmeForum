<p>Thread By: SpeedBeam<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Hello again, this seems like most of the WaW posts I make are mostly mine. (Unfortunately with lots of problems that some were helped with, some I had to do it myself because let&#39;s face it. It&#39;s too inactive on this section here) But I just recently placed xSanchez78&#39;s unlimited client system on my WaW, basically injected it for a custom HUD design of BO3&#39;s HUD and this happened.</p><p style="text-align:left;"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/LiuI5R7.png"> As you can see here, it wouldn&#39;t load because I haven&#39;t placed it in the mods/mapname folder. But as I put it there, this happened.</p><p style="text-align:left;"><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/G56d0mx.png"> Considering how the script would be really useful, and yet this happens. I don&#39;t know why, maybe I forgot to comment it out? Anyways, thanks for noticing this. If you know a fix, let me know.</p></p>
