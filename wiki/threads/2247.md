<p>Reply By: ItalianMilkMan<br />This is really great! Thanks for putting in the effort :D<br /><br />Only two issue that I found though, the <em>vehicle_ger_wheeled_sdk222_d</em> does not have its wheels textured.<br /><br />And with the <em>vehicle_ger_tracked_halftrack</em>, two errors will appear when linking the map, and its due to the &#39;<em>i_halftrack_markings.001_c</em>&#39; image and material. I saw that you had already made another material to override the original material, so all I had to do was delete the &#39;<em>i_halftrack_markings.001_c</em>&#39; image and material files in APE.<br /><br /><br /><br />Other than that, awesome job! Would like to see more things like this later on hopefully :D</p>

<p>I did these not long after release. There&#39;s a few errors. Make sure you download all the files in the XMODELS folder, and use the most recent GDT (included).<br />There is a few broken models in there. Just Wraith not ripping properly at the time I ripped. Probably would rip ok now.<br />Enjoy :)<br /><br />WW2 Textures and Models -  <a href="https://mega.nz/#F!AHxyzIaZ!ufU6NoQ6wA2dfVwlZRYRyw">https://mega.nz/#F!AHxyzIaZ!ufU6NoQ6wA2dfVwlZRYRyw</a></p>

<p>That&#39;s correct. it&#39;s faster for you to rip the textures for the models yourself. Since they were ripped as .Tiff, the xmodel texture directory is 76 gig. I&#39;m not uploading that. What I would do (if I were you) would be to edit the GDT and replace .tiff with .png and re-rip the textures so they are smaller. All the models are correctly set up in the GDT (except a few) with diffuse, spec, occ, gloss etc in correct place. As long as you have the correct path, it will work flawlessly.</p>
