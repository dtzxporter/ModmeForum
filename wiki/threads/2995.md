<p>I can&#39;t test my map. While my map is loading ready to be tested it crushing on me, i think is this error if not let me know what&#39;s going on? Before i break something (lol not really but i am gettin&#39; frustrated) Thanks.</p>

<p>Most likely not why it crashes while loading (we need to see the error list), but a BSP leakfile is an object (brush or model) outside the skybox, or sticky out through the box. leaking to the outside of the box</p>
