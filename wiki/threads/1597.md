<p>Thread By: Wild<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Hello, I was trying to port over the body bag model from Mob of the Dead. I followed CraftDAnimations&#39; tutorial, which can be found here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLXp7cAZ_nU&t=674s">Click Here</a></p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">Here are images of what the model looks like in radiant, which is also how it looks in game: </p><p style="text-align:left;"><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ep7vx8J" frameborder="0"></iframe></p><p style="text-align:left;"><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8cKVIdV" frameborder="0"></iframe></p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">Any tips on how to fix this?</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">Also in APE when CraftDAnimations selected metal for the meterial and all that stuff I selected cloth...so if that has something to do with the problem I don&#39;t really know :/</p></p>

<p>Reply By: Optomusprime22<br /><p style="text-align:left;">What it is, is that a texture is missing i had that same issue when i ported it. What i did was make a new material and made it transparent like he shown in his electric cherry tutorial if you seen it. Then overide the barbed wire with it.</p></p>
