<p>Hiya!<br /><br />Okay, so um, I&#39;m pretty sure other DOOM mods (Call of DOOM) use weapon models rather than sprites, and I was wondering if there&#39;s an easy explanation as to how to extract say, the Locus and be able to port it into DOOM as a potential add-on. Do note, I do have autism, so please, please be patient with me as I may not always understand things right away, but I do have a better time understanding if something is explained in chunks rather then all at once. Thank you in advance!</p>
