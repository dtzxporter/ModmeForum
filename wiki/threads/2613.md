<p>You&#39;re &quot;the man&quot; Madgaz  &#128079; <br />Just one quick question: I&#39;m using Harry&#39;s perks, does this means I just need to add yours like this?<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.27.png' | relative_url }}"></p>

These identifiers are how the stock perks themselves are setup, so if you register your perks like the stock ones. it will also function properly w/o harry&#39;s perks. See <a href="https://wiki.modme.co/wiki/black_ops_3/lua_(lui)/intermediate_modifications/Adding-Perk-Slots-(Factory-Base).html">Adding perk slots</a> for more info...</p>

Hold off for now. I&#39;ll have an updated link for Madgaz to distribute in about 4-6 hours, with the sounds for Wunderfizz, required anims and anything else I fucked up, which will fix the freezing on Wunderfizz as well as include the sounds, anims and models for anything else I missed.<br /><br />I will also write new instructions, as it really was thrown together super quick (obviously with all the issues).</p>

PLEASE REPORT ANY BUGS YOU FIND OR HAVE<br /></blockquote><br /><br />After playing with it for a bit I realized that with Banana Colada the slime you ooze while sliding is way too bright for night maps. The default prices for Colada and Crusader&#39;s Ale is set to 10 points as well. Installing right away sort of removes the perk icons from Harrybo21&#39;s perks as well. The perks all work fine but the lua files seem to have a capability issue</p>

Simply open up the list and add the perk icons back and they&#39;ll start working again. You will either edit the one in the usermap (if you copied my version) mapname\ui\uieditor\menus\hud<br /><br />OR I believe Harry&#39;s instructions tell you to install directly to Bo3\Zone_Source <br /><br />I&#39;ve got an updated pack, with correct pricing and what not, but I&#39;m testing it extensively for MG so hopefully there will only be one last release. You might notice each perk is also called &quot;Atomic Liqueur&quot; when you buy it, among few other inconsistencies and minor annoyances caused by me.</p>

<p><blockquote>nvm i fixed it but the only question i have is why does it only cost 10 points<br /></blockquote><br />If you open the perks GSH file (located in yourmap&gt;scripts&gt;zm) find this line:<br /> #define MADGAZ_MOONSHINE_PERK_COST                    10 //2000 (should be second line under &quot;settings&quot; change 10 to 2000 or whatever you want it to be <br /><br />that is for Madgaz_Moonshine. do the same thing for other perks if need be</p>

<p>Hello <strong>[USER=151]Madgaz[/USER] I really just wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you so very much for all that you do. I follow you, jaybird, and uptown on you tube for your BO3 tutorials. It really is amazing what all of you modders here are capable of. I&#39;m so new to modding I have only been doing like two weeks now. I haven&#39;t got to the point of adding in custom perks, but your custom perks are what made me wan&#39;t to star to mod. I will be using your perks when I get there, but I&#39;m still having trouble getting the custom weapon wallbuys to have a cost and let me use them, I ca&#39;t even change the cost of any wall buy weapon in the .csv weapon table. I hope to one day make my own perk got some good ideas, but till then I will be more than happy to use what you have provided. THANK YOU.</strong></p>

<p><blockquote>Not everyone has Harry&#39;s perks, you can&#39;t find any of his assets online and that&#39;s why I always keep a copy of every single asset I download :)<br /></blockquote><br />True as I have everything of Harry’s but you can make wardogs perks work within the wounderfizz 2.0 just go into the the script (can’t think off top of my head you have three gsc csc and the third one you need and script them in it isn’t that hard just make sure you have the right ones in</p>

<p>Thanks for the release. Working well for me besides one thing. If I include the Max Ammo code in my map gsc, but I dont have the max ammo machine in the map, I get infinite blackscreen when running the map. Just thought that was odd. Can update my comment if I figure out a simple workaround besides commenting it out.</p>
