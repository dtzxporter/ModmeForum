<p>Your best bet is to come up with a really good ability and try and get someone to help you with it who has experience. Unless you can script etc.. I would suggest you edit this post and write what your proposed perk would do and maybe someone will offer to help with it... or you could message someone who has made their own perks before and see if they will help you.</p>
