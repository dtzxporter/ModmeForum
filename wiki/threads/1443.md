function init_power()
{
    level flag::wait_till("power_on");
    level util::set_lighting_state(2);
    self PlaySound( "mus_gameover_intro" );
    // thread zm_utility::really_play_2D_sound("MY_SOUND_ALIAS");

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />I have used this in the past so if it doesn&#39;t work it&#39;s on you<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
function sound_on_power()
{
level waittill("power_on");

foreach(player in GetPlayers())
	{

 		player PlayLocalSound("power_on_mus");
 		IPrintLnBold("sound");

	}
}	
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}

And it wasnâ€™t working because nobody was called to play the function ^^</p>

<p>Reply By: TheJaguarPlays<br /><blockquote><em>kingkenny</em><br />QuentinN33 self Playsound(&quot;aliases&quot;);  thank you for your reply. that didn&#39;t work. i tried self playsound(&quot;MY_SOUND_ALIAS&quot;) and self playlocalsound(&quot;MY_SOUND_ALIAS&quot;) but there is still no sound when turning on the power.i also tried a non-custom soundalias to make sure that it&#39;s not my file that doesn&#39;t work but no, even then i had no sound.this is my current function init_power() function init_power() { level flag::wait_till(&quot;power_on&quot;); level util::set_lighting_state(2); self PlaySound( &quot;mus_gameover_intro&quot; ); // thread zm_utility::really_play_2D_sound(&quot;MY_SOUND_ALIAS&quot;); }</blockquote><br /> Okay just making sure at 1 thing, are you also 100% sure your sound was actually added in your csv and also that it linked in your launcher like when you compile your map? that could also be the problem xd</p>

<p>Reply By: kingkenny<br />One more thing, <br /><br />I would like to take this thing a step further. <br />Is it possible to have a script that when a player joins the lobby (through server browser) after the game has already started will check if the power is on and if yes it will play a sound but only for the player that joined?<br /><br />btw where do you guys find all these script functions?<br />is there a list or did you have to find everything out by yourself?<br /><br />Thank you for any answer!</p>

*didn&#39;t test*<br /> <br /> <br />You can find functions <a href="https://aviacreations.com/modme/scriptdocs/">here</a> (click on the D-pad next to the search box and select bo3)<br />or you can find a lot of useful functions in share\raw\scripts\zm\_zm_utility.gsc<br />also you learn through experience</p>

(yes i did thread the new function)<br /><br />But i don&#39;t think &quot;self playLocalSound&quot; works at all because that was the first thing i tried when i wanted to play music when turning on the power, but when i simply added &quot;self playLocalSound&quot; to the init_power function earlier it didn&#39;t work.<br /><br />any ideas?</p>

<p>Reply By: xdferpc<br />try with this: <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
function power_func() //self = player
{
level.playSoundLocation PlaySound("kino_teleport_2d");
if(level flag::exists("power_on") &amp;&amp; level flag::get("power_on"))

<p>Reply By: kingkenny<br />i think the problem lies within the line:<br /><br /><br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
if(level flag::exists("power_on") &amp;&amp; level flag::get("power_on"))
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />i tried out the following<br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
function power_func() //self = player
{
if(level flag::exists("power_on") &amp;&amp; level flag::get("power_on"))
	{
 	IPrintLnBold("AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA");
	self PlayLocalSound("MY_SOUND_ALIAS");
	}

level waittill("power_on");
self PlayLocalSound("MY_SOUND_ALIAS");
}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
but neither me nor my friend had the IPrintLnBold-text on the screen.</p>
