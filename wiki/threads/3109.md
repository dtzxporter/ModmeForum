<p>Okay fellas. I finally got the witches to spawn correctly BUT...only one spawns and after I kill it...no more spawn. How can I fix this? Is it in the script or inside of radiant? Also, I&#39;m hoping for the end of July release and I just want to think spiki and all of you guys here for the time and work you all put into the community.</p>
