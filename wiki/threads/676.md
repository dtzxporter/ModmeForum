<p>Thread By: Yasser143<br />Is there a way for me to make my prefab model, disappear when the player holds F on it, and make it appear somewhere else in my map?</p>

<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br />Prefabs aren&#39;t scriptable by themselves. You need to make everything in the prefab a script_model or a script_brushmodel. Depending on how many things you have in your prefab this could be a bad idea as there is a limit to the amount of entities, aka script_models/brushmodels, you can have in the game at one time. If it is &lt;5 I wouldn&#39;t think it is an issue. There are multiple ways to go about doing it though if you decide to take that route</p>

<p>Reply By: Yasser143<br />But he still didn&#39;t explain how to make the &quot;script_brushmodel&quot; disappear/ appear.</p>

<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br />This should do what you need. Read through the code for the proper targetnames and thread this in your mapname.gsc<br /><br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
function hide_and_show()
{
	level endon( "intermission" ); 

	models = GetEntArray( "hide_show_model", "targetname" ); 
	trig = GetEnt( "hide_show_trig", "targetname" ); 
	trig SetCursorHint( "HINT_NOICON" );
	trig SetHintString( "Press and Hold ^3&amp;&amp;1^7 to Hide Models" ); 

	foreach( model in models )
		model.is_visible = true; 

	while(1)
	{		
		trig waittill( "trigger", player ); 
		foreach( model in models )
		{
			if( model.is_visible )
			{
				model hide(); 
				model.is_visible = false; 
				wait(2); 
				trig SetHintString( "Press and Hold ^3&amp;&amp;1^7 to Show Models" ); 
			}
			
			else if( !model.is_visible )
			{
				model show(); 
				model.is_visible = true; 
				wait(2); 
				trig SetHintString( "Press and Hold ^3&amp;&amp;1^7 to Hide Models" ); 
			}
		}
	}
}


{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}

Not one that makes the script_model disappear and reappear in the same location. Also wanted one that removes the trigger when used once time, so basically you cant use the trigger anymore after one use. I understand if u are to busy to help me.</p>

I can make and release an entire script as other users might find it useful to have something like this too. So I have some questions before I make it: <br /><br />1) Do you want the meteor loop sound to play on the trigger while it is waiting to be used? <br /><br />2) Do you want the order to randomize? <br /><br />3) What reward do you want after triggering it? <br /><br />4) How do you want it to be triggered? Use? Touch? Shoot?<br /><br />It wont take me long. I just can&#39;t do it without being at my home computer and me being home is all too rare anymore lol</p>

Use (a hidden trigger so players don&#39;t see the icon to pick it up).<br /><br />Sorry if Im asking for too much.</p>
