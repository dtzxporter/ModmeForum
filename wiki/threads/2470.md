<p>Reply By: Scobalula<br />Did you seek permission from each person with regards to rehosting their content through your Dropbox? Nate for example explicitly states to link back to his posts, not rehost them.</p>

I ask permission from NateSmithZombies and Emox Manga. NateSmithZombies did not answer me after several weeks of waiting. But I am obliged for the operation of the software to rehome files (I have to apply some changes to these as the change of name, directory ..). I understand that some writers do not want me to restore their resources. But on the other hand, I do not steal them. I credit them. In the software, you can right-click on a package and open the original link that links to the NateSmithZombies site. If NateSmithZombies do not want his scripts to be on my software, he can contact me and I will delete them without any problem</p>

It&#39;s not a matter of &quot;stealing&quot; them, it&#39;s common decency to ask, if you do not get a response, do not continue, he explicitly states do not re host them, that&#39;s your answer. I&#39;d suggest getting permission, and from anyone in the future, we&#39;ve had people understandably in the past get a bit annoyed over others re-hosting their assets.<br /> <br />I like the idea of the app, but to me personally it&#39;s another way for people to just download a heck ton of assets and not care about who made them, aka not credit the original authors.</p>

When installing a package, the software will add script credits at the bottom left when launching a map</p>

<p>Reply By: Ping998<br />I think maybe when you add a script you should also include a function in the user&#39;s mapname.gsc that prints a statement giving credit to the person(s)&#39;s script used.</p>
