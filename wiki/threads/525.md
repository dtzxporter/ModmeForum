<p>Thread By: HolaBam<br />So, I seem to be having issues with ladders, have never had a use for them before. They work fine up until the top, you can&#39;t get onto whatever you&#39;re meant to climb onto, you just fall straight down. Could someone show me a screenshot of a proper working ladder in radiant so I can try to see what I am doing wrong?</p>

I found that they don&#39;t work unless you jump when you are at the top. Maybe you can make the texture taller than the ladder</p>
