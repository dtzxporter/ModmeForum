But don&#39;t put it at 0, i couldn&#39;t jump then xD)<br /> <br />You think you can do it? :p</p>

function changegravity()                                           // function [name] ()
{
trigster = GetEnt("change_it", "targetname");            //add a trigger, in script it&#39;s called trigster with this function, in Radiant, add a trigger_use called "change_it"
trigster SetHintString("ON");                                  //this is to make the message "ON" appear while you&#39;re at the trigger
trigster waittill("trigger", player);                          //the next lines only activate when you activate the trigger
player SetPlayerGravity(100);                           //set the player gravity to 100
trigster Delete();                                          //delete the trigger so you don&#39;t see the trigger / message anymore. You can also use Hide();
}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
Also in function Main() add:<br /> <br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
thread changegravity();
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
 <br />I am kinda inexperienced in scripting too, so don&#39;t expect it&#39;s perfect :p<br /> <br /> <br />Edit: I&#39;m kinda curious now, do we need to use<br /> <br /> <br />{% highlight php %}{% raw %}
ZeroGravityVolumeOn([volume_name]);
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
? If so, i&#39;ve been trying to use it, but it won&#39;t work.</p>
