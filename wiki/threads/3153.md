<p>I haven&#39;t seen any tutorials on this... Even a simple Tranzit/Die Rise/Buried style version that puts the parts on the normal screen instead of the tab menu is fine. I just want some form of part list for the shield and Ragnaroks.</p>

<p>Just some stuff i was working on. Should work fine but never had anyone else test it for me. Maybe test it and let me know how well it works. Used the same tutorial Nobody shared and it helped me out a lot<br /><a href="https://mega.nz/folder/FrRyQQwT#mvU3Emw8c4zAqdaNR30WJQ">https://mega.nz/folder/FrRyQQwT#mvU3Emw8c4zAqdaNR30WJQ</a></p>
