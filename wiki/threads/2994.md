<p>4 playable characters - $200<br /><br />Basically what I&#39;m looking for is to have 4 characters from Apex Legends turned into playable characters (Wraith, Pathfinder, Wattson, Mirage). I have Models and textures. Models are in FBX format.<br /><br />I&#39;m good for the money.<br /><br />I realize that I already posted this once on my original account, but after making the mistake of donating to modme forums, my original account can no longer access the forums so I cant edit the post etc.</p>
