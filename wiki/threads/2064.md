<p>Thread By: mathfag<br />To everyone who has sound errors:<br /> <br />Go to <span style="color:#ffff00;">BO3/usermaps/mapname/zone/snd</span> and delete all the folder(s) in there. <br />Then keep linking your map until the folders reapear and the folder &quot;<span style="color:#ffff00;">all</span>&quot; has a <span style="color:#ffff00;">.sabs</span> and a <span style="color:#ffff00;">.sabl</span> file in it.<br />If it still doesn&#39;t work, post a topic here.<br />Until you do this, please don&#39;t say it doesn&#39;t work.</p>
