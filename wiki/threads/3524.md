<p>Hey everyone! I want to set up a sound file to play right as the players spawn in, like in MOTD for example. I looked online and can&#39;t find what I&#39;m looking for so I&#39;m posting it here, hoping someone can either help me or point me in the right direction. I&#39;ve already got custom round sounds if that matters. Thanks in advance!</p>

callback::on_spawned(&amp;on_player_spawn);


function on_player_spawn() //self = player
{
self PlayLocalSound(&lt;sound name&gt;);

}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}

</blockquote><br /><br />thanks for this man! I&#39;m assuming it goes in my gsc, idk where else it would go lol. Do I have to put in a specific place in my file or can I just drop it anywhere in there and have it work?</p>
