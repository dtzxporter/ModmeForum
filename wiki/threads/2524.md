<p>Thread By: GerardS0406<br />I&#39;m trying to create a custom friendly ai (I have ported over the models and anims already into waw as well as the character and aitype) but I&#39;m stuck as to how to get the ai&#39;s anims to work and how to get the ai to move. For the moment, I just want the ai to follow a set path. If anyone can help, that would be great!</p>
