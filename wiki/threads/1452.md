<p>Thread By: ihmiskeho<br />For some reason when using the player reviving for a custom feature (afterlife / who&#39;s who), the revive trigger angles are very messed up with custom characters. However, the normal reviving (for when players actually go down) works just fine.<br /> <br />This happens both with Harrys Who&#39;s Who script as well as my afterlife script. However, both of us have used the exact revive code that can be found in _zm_laststand.gsc. So it doesn&#39;t make any sense to me why Treyarch&#39;s revive functionality works, but ours doesn&#39;t.<br /> <br /> <br />I am using Erthrocks playermodels, which can be found here: <a href="https://aviacreations.com/modme/index.php?view=topic&tid=2243">https://aviacreations.com/modme/index.php?view=topic&amp;tid=2243</a> and as far as I know, they&#39;re direct ports from Zombe Chronicles.<br />This glitch does <strong>NOT</strong> happen with default (giant) characters.<br /> <br /> <br />Video to demonstrate issue:<br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b-XwT6ONhCw" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><em>(ignore crappy afterlife hands)</em><br /> <br />Picture that shows that normal reviving works just fine:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/sjWfMeI.jpg"><br /> <br />So does anyone have any ideas? If Treyarch uses some other code than the one in _laststand.gsc, is there a way to use that code? Or can this be fixed in Maya?</p>

<p>Reply By: greeNTheBoyz<br />I would go post this onto Erthrock&#39;s thread too. Not sure how you&#39;d fix, sorry.</p>
