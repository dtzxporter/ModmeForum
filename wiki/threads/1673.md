<p>Thread By: Runis<br />Hey I&#39;m wondering how would I go about porting a Black Ops 2 camo, specifically the WAW PAP camo DLC pack. Also would I need to own the camo or could I just use a CodTV gamemode. Not experienced in anything coding or modding related so simple words would help. By the way I don&#39;t have a problem buying the camo for this if needed. can&#39;t find tutorials for this online anywhere which is why i&#39;m here.</p>

<p>Reply By: Scobalula<br />You do not need to buy the camos to rip them, they are stored in the iPaks (I think all are in patch_mp), ones from Origins and MOTD may require you to own the DLC Pack as their camos may be stored in their respective iPak.<br /> <br />Azsry covers PaP camos in this tutorial (Note that you will need different material type depending on camo, as Azsry uses 3 layer scroll iirc, while some might just be basic lit_&lt;type&gt; camos or basic emissives).&lt;/type&gt;<br /> <br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yK7zmhyFTp4" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
