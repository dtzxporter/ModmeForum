<p>Thread By: MyNameIsNobody<br />I have two models i placed on my map that spin out of control whenever in game but appear perfectly normal in radiant. One is the Giant robot head, the other is just a piece of cloth. No other models having this issue. Can anyone help me out?<br /> <br />The problem can be seen in this clip:<br /> <br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qnhqvYJq9Z0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
