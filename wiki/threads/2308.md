<p>Reply By: Wild<br />I&#39;m not trying to be a dick but can you just explain this post to me? I don&#39;t get why you&#39;re passing these off as your weapons but then saying all credit goes to John Burnette. Why release things that aren&#39;t yours. Also your post was made on June 6th. But on May 11th John actually released around 100 of his weapons, including the ones you added to this post. So again, I am not trying to be a dick but why did you make this post?</p>

This post helps with that crap by organizing the GDT. and its other files but i won&#39;t lie i wish his credit was bigger then just his name being typed normally with a <span style="color:#ff0000;">red font</span>. Just a <span style="color:#00ff00;">friendly</span> note for everyone reading this from some other time period, Remember we don&#39;t actually own any of the guns that get ported Activision does.</p>

And it&#39;s not the credit to him that&#39;s the problem to me. The problem is that itznvy is passing it off as his. The title of the post is &quot;itznvy&#39;s weapons&quot; and if you download the MG42 for example it&#39;s called &quot;itznvy&#39;s MG42&quot;. That&#39;s the problem, that hes passing them off as his when all he did was organize each weapon which I understand is a very helpful thing, but at the same time anyone with more than 10 minutes used on a computer should be able to organize them. If you download John&#39;s pack of the 100 weapons it takes 2 extra minutes to organize it so you have just 1 weapon. Does that make sense? I am so bad at wording lol. But that&#39;s my concern with this post is that he is reuploading someone else&#39;s work, passing it off mostly as his own when all he is doing is 2 minutes worth or organization and I just don&#39;t get the point of it.</p>

I just sent a sound fix for john. He said he didn&#39;t know the fix. If you want i can remove all post and make it where the community can&#39;t have it. Im giving John all the credit. I can&#39;t change the title that&#39;s for a mod. And if you don&#39;t want me to post them, honestly just don&#39;t download them. I will discuss this with John</p>

<p>Reply By: itznvy<br />Actually Nevermind John Burnette did give me permission to post these weapons, he said it&#39;s fine as long as they are not the broken waw weapons. He thinks im supporting his work and that&#39;s what im doing. Give me other ways to credit him and i will do so.</p>

It just doesn&#39;t make sense because the reason the weapons aren&#39;t organized in the first place is because again, the pack is meant to be installed all together. I&#39;m not saying to remove your post but I just don&#39;t get all of what I mentioned and then why you are saying it&#39;s your weapons. I get you say all credit goes to john but still. &quot;Organization&quot; isn&#39;t something that changes someone&#39;s work to your own release. If I had a suggestion what I would do is fix the things that you are fixing, talk to John, help him fix and organize his pack and then you two create a new post together with a download to an updated, fixed weapon pack with credit given to you both and then obviously all the companies that created the weapons. Again I am not trying to hate or anything I&#39;m just confused and want to make this more logical if that makes sense.</p>

As of the damage if you want you can just go in ape from the launcher and search mg42 in the gdt search bar and find the file &quot;mg42&quot;, click on that then search damage in the top right, then you&#39;ll see damage range 1 (max) then just change that to your liking. I may re-upload it with a damage buff, i&#39;ve done it myself but i might just upload it.</p>

I looked in ape turns out it doesn&#39;t have a sprint loop set or a sprint in, and sprint out. Maybe because it didn&#39;t have one. I can try to see if zeroy knows anything. As of now i can&#39;t fix the sprint. I plan to update them maybe Later today. I might release another one of John&#39;s ports. John told me that alot of the waw weapons had issues, i released the 2 i noticed didn&#39;t have many.</p>

As of the damage if you want you can just go in ape from the launcher and search mg42 in the gdt search bar and find the file &quot;mg42&quot;, click on that then search damage in the top right, then you&#39;ll see damage range 1 (max) then just change that to your liking.

As of now i can&#39;t fix the sprint. I plan to update them maybe Later today. I might release another one of John&#39;s ports.
