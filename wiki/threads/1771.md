<p>Thread By: GorillaBlurr19<br />Am I missing something with the rags? Ive tested it now taking everything out the box except for monkeys, dingo, and thunder gun. When I got all that the box keeps/kept flashing the rags but to my surprise landed on a random weapon even tho I took out everything except what I mentiond. It evn gave me the shield which I havent tested yet, its like it couldn&#39;t find a weapon to give so it turned everything to true.<br /><br />It just wont give me the rags, it cant be bcuz I dnt have the dlc cuz it still gives me the mark3z and I dnt have gorod krovi</p>
