<p>Reply By: TrueGamerCalls<br /><blockquote><em>Dick_Nixon</em><br />Hi, me again.   Thought i&#39;d add a bit more spice to the community with another character pack, so here they are, The Ultimus Crew as they appeared in BO3! This character pack contains 12 different varients of characters : the 4 ultimus crew characters, 4 of them in space suits, and 4 of them in spacesuits with helmets. The instructions are contained within the download, and they&#39;re split up into two sections, 1 for people who&#39;ve downloaded custom characters before, and 1 for people who haven&#39;t. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOU FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS EXACTLY, OR THE CHARACTERS WILL NOT WORK.   When you download this, make sure to credit me as &quot;The Indestructable Mike Pence&quot; in the description of your map for porting the characters.   Thanks!   -The Indestructable Mike Pence    </blockquote><br /> HOLY SHIT THANK YOU!!!! I&#39;VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE A SPACE MAP AND I KEEP MESSING UP WHEN PORTING THE SPACE CREW!!!!!! YOU ARE A LEGEND 999999+ WINS FOR YOU<br /> <br /> <br />Edit: Do you know how to have the mask overlay on the player&#39;s screen? I don&#39;t know the script, but I have the overlay image.</p>

<p>Reply By: Runis<br />I&#39;m getting the duplicate errors and they&#39;re for the normal vanilla The Giant characters, what do I delete or is it possible to change the names of one?</p>

<p>Reply By: iAr7uRo<br /><blockquote><em>Modzzzzzzz</em><br />Every time I link and compile and get into my map I am just the 4 Giant Characters your CDC characters work for me but not these I think they are interfering with the original characters in some way any help would be lovely</blockquote><br /> Open the APE and look for the duplicate assets that you check in the compiler, DO NOT erase the originals that contain the GDT &quot;Global character&quot; only delete the copies that are obviously the assets that you added Mike Pence&#39;s BO3 Ultimus Character pack. It&#39;s just that and follow the instructions on how to install them and that&#39;s it.</p>
