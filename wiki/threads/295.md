<p>Thread By: XxCAFxX<br />Okay so basically my whole base map is fine. But every time i make a new room everything looks fine in radient but as soon as i launch the game when i go to the new room i made the perk machines, pap and other objects including the textures on the wall go invisible.. if i move around they pop in and out but i just dont understand.. everything is inside the skybox, volume, umbra, etc.. i&#39;ve tried adding probes, deleting probes, moving the whole room to another place in the map.. i even tried placing the whole new room inside of my starting room and it still does it.. pleas someone help me with this because i&#39;m stumped. sorry if this is in the wrong category</p>
