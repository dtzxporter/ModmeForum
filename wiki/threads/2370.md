<p>Reply By: D-2-K<br />ok so does the napalm zombie use genesis animations cant tell in ape <br /> <br />zm_t7_napalm_zombie.ai_bt<br /> <br />zm_t7_napalm_zombie.ai_asm<br /> <br />zm_t7_napalm_zombie.ai_ast<br /> <br />zm_t7_napalm_zombie.ai_am        <br /> <br />unlike zombies for example Ethrocks releases use factory and i changed them all to genesis after i realised they were not traversing <br /> <br />however i played about on my test map today and the mk3 deletes the napalm model if said napalm had green mist from vulture aid i could still see the mist walking to me but not the napalm zombie <br />and that apothican gun seems to delete the hit box&#39;s (if thats what you even call them ) so that the model still walks towards me but &quot;no gun&quot; will kill them even installed nates hitmarkers to see what would happen and any of the napalm zombies effected by the Apothicon gun had no hit markers showing up in them still trying to get a vid sorted out to show you im off work the next 2 days so ill try to repeat this again and give you a visual of what im trying to say <br /> <br />sorry to be a bother m8</p>

<p>Reply By: AUsernameLz443<br />Harry could be considered thread-dead. He removed all assets created by him and didn&#39;t bother to delete these posts or even remove download button.<br />I don&#39;t think he will come back anytime soon so it&#39;s safe to say not to expect a post from him. He <strong>was</strong> a legend in his time. Maybe we should have given credit where it was required. I would think his reasoning for removing the assets is valid, but extreme. This topic is claiming to offer something it cannot offer and I can&#39;t see a reason why it&#39;s still alive or not even locked. Maybe if he said he&#39;ll be returning after a week or two, then I&#39;d keep thread open. It&#39;s a release to a dead end and not be healthy for forums. I can back it up too;<br /> <br />Someone sees Napalm Zombie Port download from web search under the website name: modme<br />&quot;Huh, link isn&#39;t working. I wasted time creating an account thanks to modme.&quot;<br /> <br />Their next web search; Screamer Zombie, from modme<br />&quot;No download. Modme is really unreliable...&quot;<br />*User omits modme from search results* -1 Potential User<br />This could happen to several people.<br /> <br />I respect Harry&#39;s decision and intents, but I&#39;m not encouraging the ideas.<br />For him to leave the thread alive could mean one or more of these<br />-He wanted to hurt us by leaving false hope<br />-He&#39;s planning returning and does not want to recreate threads<br />-He forgot about it<br />-He&#39;s lazy<br /> <br />I&#39;m not throwing flames, just really really bored.</p>

<p>Hi sorry there was a way to remove the effect of fire damage when a zombie napal dies. Since if I die if I have any brutes, it dies because of the fire that leaves the Napal when I die</p>
