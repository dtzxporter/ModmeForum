<p>Thread By: Ping998<br />Hello everyone! It&#39;s Ping998 back again with another work in progress!<br /> <br />This time I will be re-creating one of my most community-favoured maps - Bunbury!<br /> <br />You might be thinking right now: &quot;Oh god, not another remaster&quot;. Well, it&#39;s technically not a &quot;remaster&quot; as such, the map file itself was lost for the original 2014 map so I&#39;ve had to re-build it from scratch! This does mean however, that the map won&#39;t be 1:1 and I&#39;ve also changed areas to flow better in BO3 gameplay (little things here and there). This is why I&#39;m calling it a &quot;Redux&quot; version. Right now the map&#39;s layout is finished, the only thing that needs to be added is all the perk locations, power switches and the buttons (also the buyable ending).<br /> <br />Re-creating maps also gives me and everyone the ability to see how much has changed over the years and gives me insight as to how I&#39;ve improved as a mapper!<br /> <br />Planned Release Date: July 2018<br /> <br />Here are some images: WaW vs BO3<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/bcf144cd0494374563df419927d9c872.png"><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/10e9b62e046b4f48e647a0d53a444303.jpg"><br /> <br />And here are some more in-game screenshots!<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/49ffa805d8a816a2e6116c0dcaaae516.jpg"><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/e2b591a3efc186c3f001b323763a6cac.jpg"><br /> <br /> <br />Hope you will all enjoy this when it is released!<br /> <br />If you have any comments, suggestions or feedback at this stage please let me know!<br /> <br />Thank you,<br /> <br />- Ping998, out</p>
