<p>Thread By: Ping998<br />Just wondering if there was a way I could include wall weapons such as the Kuda or KN-44 in the box and also be able to remove weapons like the cymbal monkeys?<br /><br /><br /><br />I&#39;ve probably been too dumb and overlooked it lol.<br /><br /><br /><br />Any ideas guys?<br /><br /><br /><br />- Ping</p>
