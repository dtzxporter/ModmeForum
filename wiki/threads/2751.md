<p>Hi there,<br /><br />I&#39;ve got the Sickle weapon to replace the bowie knife for my map however, when you purchase widow&#39;s wine, the melee is replaced with the default widow&#39;s wine knife.<br /><br />Is there a way to change the knife used when you have widow&#39;s wine?<br /><br />Any suggestions would be appreciated :)<br /><br />- Ping</p>

<p>zm_utility::register_melee_weapon_for_level( WIDOWS_WINE_KNIFE );<br />    level.w_widows_wine_knife = GetWeapon( WIDOWS_WINE_KNIFE );<br /><br />    zm_utility::register_melee_weapon_for_level( WIDOWS_WINE_BOWIE_KNIFE );<br />    level.w_widows_wine_bowie_knife = GetWeapon( WIDOWS_WINE_BOWIE_KNIFE );<br />    <br />    zm_utility::register_melee_weapon_for_level( WIDOWS_WINE_SICKLE_KNIFE );<br />    level.w_widows_wine_sickle_knife = GetWeapon( WIDOWS_WINE_SICKLE_KNIFE );<br />}<br /><br />maybe where it says &quot;WIDOWS_WINE_KNIFE&quot; replace it with the name for the sickle? <br />possibly  change this (approximately line 179): <br /><br />// replace your knife with widows_wine knife<br />        self TakeWeapon( self.w_widows_wine_prev_knife ); <br /><br />so it doesn&#39;t replace your knife? (possibly by deleting) I&#39;m no expert, but that would be my best guess, hope this helps</p>
