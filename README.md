# Welcome to the Modme Wiki (Source Repo)

An open-source community driven game modding wiki, founded by [DTZxPorter](https://twitter.com/dtzxporter), built for the community.

## Welcome
As you can see, we have started to migrate the old wiki contents here so that we can continue to provide an up-to-date and resource rich experience for modders. Please excuse the look of some pages while we revamp their contents!

## Contributing
- The wiki is `100%` community driven and most of the work was submitted by non-staff members of Modme.
- All you need to contribute is a Github account and you're good to go!
- Edit or submit new pages from the `/wiki` subdirectory and make sure they are linked properly.
- If a new game directory is required, please follow the current layout before making changes.
- With all posts, try and follow the general layout that has been preserved throughout the wiki.
